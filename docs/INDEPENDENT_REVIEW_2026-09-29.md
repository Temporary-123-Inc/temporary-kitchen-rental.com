# Independent Review — 2026-09-29

- Reviewer: Basalt Badger (`cavecrew-reviewer-basalt-01`)
- Baseline: `f7d14aaaa9a0d3f5d091a801ed25141d9f2eb7eb`
- Scope: the complete Portable Food Bank audit diff, with focused re-review of cross-domain route isolation, current-site Search Console targeting, homepage portfolio documentation, multiple quote-form hydration, and the supported test manifest.
- Result: **PASS**
- Open findings: `[]`

The reviewer verified that the five initial findings were resolved. A first re-review identified three evidence/documentation mismatches: two stale records and a browser assertion that counted two quote islands without independently exercising each one. The records now reflect 664 current-site routes plus 404 and exclude imported PortableFoodBank authority paths from publication. The browser acceptance now submits both quote islands without external delivery, observes a separate React validation alert in each island, and opens the drawer through its accessible contact control. The final focused check passed, and the full release browser suite passed 10/10.
