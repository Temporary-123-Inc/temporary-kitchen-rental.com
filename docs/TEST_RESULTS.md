# PortableFoodBank Test Results

## 2026-10-03 — Full public-route indexing and sitemap candidate

- Owner explicitly approved removing noindex from the public static site. Production prerender now emits `index,follow`, self-canonicals, and sitemap URLs for eligible public routes; `robots.txt` permits site crawling except `/api/` and points to the canonical sitemap. Vercel preview host noindex protection is preserved.
- `pnpm build` — PASS, 664 routes + 404. `pnpm test` — PASS, 13 files / 77 tests. `pnpm check:seo` — PASS, 658 eligible canonical URLs, no audit problems, no pending migration links. `pnpm check:cities` — PASS, 19,702 Census places, 246 region directories, 5 reviewed city guides. `pnpm check:generated` — PASS, 665 HTML files, 90,013 links, 12,427 images, 664 structured-data payloads, 670 forms. `pnpm check:links` — PASS, 664 pages; zero missing/case defects. `pnpm check:headlines` — PASS, 548 unique headlines. Typecheck, `pnpm check:release`, `pnpm check:brand`, secret scan, and `git diff --check` pass.
- The 658 sitemap entries match the current candidate’s indexable route registry. Private SEO tooling, duplicate aliases, unapproved/empty testimonials, legacy customer-testimonial copy and unverified video media remain reachable where appropriate but `noindex,follow`; these are not sitemap entries. Government approval and GSA pages are sanitized to avoid attributing unverified procurement/contract claims and are included as truthful information pages. `origin/main` advanced during validation; incoming identity-cleanup changes were integrated. Commit `8c6910c` was pushed to `Portable-Food-Bank/portable-food-bank.com` `main`.
- Post-push live verification — PASS after delayed Git-triggered deployment: `https://portable-food-bank.com/robots.txt` contains `Sitemap: https://portable-food-bank.com/sitemap.xml`; live `/sitemap.xml` contains 658 `<loc>` entries; `/` returns HTTP 200 with `index,follow`; GSA and government-approval pages return HTTP 200 with `index,follow`, self-canonicals, and no old contract numbers or DLA/SBA approval claims. `/service-areas/` also returns 200 with `index,follow` and a self-canonical. The stable `portable-food-bank-com-theta.vercel.app` alias serves the same sitemap while retaining response header `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow`. The Vercel connector returned 403 for scope `portable-food-bank-team`, so the deployment ID/revision was not directly queried; deployed output itself was verified over HTTPS.
- Google Search Console ownership, sitemap submission, and actual Google indexing are outside this deployment check and are not verified.

## 2026-09-30 — Portable Food Bank public-identity residue removal

- Audited homepage-visible copy, title/meta and JSON-LD inputs, image alt/title/captions, SEO dashboard evidence, public helper scripts, prerendered HTML/state, generated JavaScript, XML/SVG output, and the binary social card for improper former-identity references.
- Replaced the stale binary `social-card.png` from the corrected Portable Food Bank SVG and visually confirmed the logo, domain label, phone number, and supporting-family wording.
- `npm run build` — PASS: TypeScript and Vite build completed and prerender generated 664 pages plus 404. Existing JSON import-attribute, third-party annotation, and large-chunk warnings remain.
- `npm test` — PASS: 13 test files / 76 tests. The SEO dashboard regression now requires path-only legacy evidence and rejects former identity text.
- `npm run check:brand` — PASS: zero former-identity matches in generated HTML, JavaScript, JSON, SVG, XML, CSS, and text assets.
- `npm run check:generated` — PASS: 665 HTML files, 86,053 links, 12,427 images, 664 structured-data payloads, and 670 forms; zero failures. Existing warning: draft `/service-areas/oklahoma/panhandle/` emits one canonical.
- `npm run check:links` — PASS: 664 pages, zero capitalization issues, zero missing targets.
- Existing URLs, slugs, route count, domain routing, layout, H1 intent, approved family balance, and indexing policy were unchanged.
- Release: implementation commit `fec9dad` pushed to `origin/main`; existing-project production deployment `dpl_88E8V3gPJPAxguMoXKMP4RYNnhmz` reached Ready. Vercel inspection lists `https://portable-food-bank-com-theta.vercel.app` and `https://portable-food-bank.com` as aliases of that exact deployment.
- Exhaustive live artifact audit — PASS independently on both hosts: 665/665 generated routes requested, six public JS/CSS/SVG/XML assets checked, zero former-identity matches. The literal static `/404.html` artifact returns 200 as a file; an unknown route follows the normal slash redirect and returns the generated 404 with no former identity.
- Browser-runtime audit — PASS independently on both hosts: HTTP 200, title `Temporary Commercial Mobile Kitchen Facility Rentals Nationwide | Portable Food Bank`, one expected H1, zero former-identity matches in visible body, JSON-LD, or image alt/title attributes, zero console errors, and live `/social-card.png` SHA-256 identical to the visually reviewed local asset.

## 2026-09-30 — Original-domain Vercel routing verification

- Vercel UI: `portable-food-bank-team/portable-food-bank-com` reports `portable-food-bank.com` as **Valid Configuration / Production** and `www.portable-food-bank.com` as **Valid Configuration / 308 -> portable-food-bank.com** after moving both entries from `portable-food-bank-team/portable-food-bank`.
- Public DNS: apex A resolves to `216.150.1.1`; `www` CNAME resolves to `56dd81f9194c50e2.vercel-dns-016.com` (currently backed by Vercel A addresses `216.150.16.1` and `216.150.1.1`).
- HTTPS: apex returns `200 OK` from Vercel; `www` returns `308 Permanent Redirect` with `Location: https://portable-food-bank.com/`.
- Indexing boundary: apex and sitemap responses still include `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow`; page markup contains `noindex,follow`, the production canonical is absent, and `robots.txt` says revision HTML remains noindex while the primary domain is elsewhere. Domain routing is verified, but indexability is not released or claimed.
- No registrar, source-code, page-content, route, layout, form, or deployment mutation was performed in this domain-routing step.

## 2026-09-30 — Homepage V16.3 intent-copy follow-up, integrated candidate

- Baseline before this follow-up: one H1, “Temporary Commercial Mobile Kitchen Rentals Nationwide”; meta description, “Temporary commercial mobile kitchen rentals nationwide for hospitals, schools, military bases, government agencies, industrial facilities and commercial operations.” Concurrent work had also introduced a kitchen-first primary/support opening structure before this candidate could be pushed.
- Integrated candidate H1: “Temporary Commercial Mobile Kitchen Facility Rentals Nationwide.” Opening: “Portable Food Bank provides temporary commercial mobile kitchen trailer and modular facility rentals nationwide for hospitals, schools, military and government sites, industrial facilities, and other commercial operations. These facilities help teams maintain food service while permanent kitchens are offline during renovations, planned maintenance, emergency response, or added-capacity projects. Each kitchen plan considers the cooking line, prep flow, equipment needs, utilities, site access, and delivery logistics. Supporting rentals include temporary dishwashing facilities, refrigeration/freezer trailers, mobile shower trailers, shower/restroom trailer combinations, and man-camp/workforce housing units.” Meta description: “Temporary commercial mobile kitchen trailer and modular facility rentals nationwide for hospitals, schools, military, government, industrial and commercial operations.”
- Meaningful visible service-card phrases: “Mobile shower trailer rentals,” “Shower/restroom trailer rentals,” “Workforce housing unit rentals,” “Refrigeration/freezer trailer rentals,” and “Dishwashing facility rentals.” Metadata and alt text are not used as substitutes.
- Post-integration deterministic content audit: PASS, 430 primary and 95 supporting family-specific words out of 525, or 81.90% / 18.10%; one H1; five support families; no missing phrase. Rendered geometry: 80.00% primary at 1440 x 900 (979.1875 / 244.8125 px columns) and 77.45% at 390 x 844 (680 / 197.9375 px family-section heights).
- `npm run typecheck` — PASS. `npm test` — PASS, 13 files / 76 tests. `npm run build` — PASS, 664 pages plus 404. Focused local Playwright — PASS, 8/8. Exact desktop/mobile extraction confirms the H1, opening, meta description, five support labels, geometry, and zero console errors.
- Release: commit `83abca2cbbff7734fd3bbd30f623dc17b11e6cad` pushed to `origin/main`; exact-project production deployment `dpl_2iUYTUwUgoy8aR3yuR1xJK6SRFVz` reached Ready.
- Focused live Playwright — PASS, 8/8 independently on `https://portable-food-bank.com` and `https://portable-food-bank-com-theta.vercel.app`. Exact desktop/mobile extraction on both hosts returned HTTP 200, one H1, the expected opening/meta/support labels, 80.00% / 77.45% primary geometry, and zero console errors.
- No URL, domain, DNS, alias, indexing, or inquiry-delivery change was made.

## 2026-09-30 — State directory mobile-kitchen rental labels

- Updated the shared homepage/Service Areas directory link text for all 50 states to “Mobile Kitchen Trailer Rental in [State]”; existing routes and expandable region links remain unchanged.
- Added SSR assertions for the exact Alaska example, all 50 labels, and every state link. `pnpm exec vitest run tests/mapLocationDirectory.test.tsx` — PASS, 1 test. `pnpm typecheck` — PASS. `pnpm build` — PASS, 664 static pages + 404; existing JSON import, third-party annotation, and large-chunk warnings remain. `git diff --check` — PASS.
- A direct check of the generated prerender HTML did not expose the directory strings. Commit `afc4a8e` was pushed to `origin/main`; a fresh browser tab on the public homepage still showed bare state labels at the time of the check. Vercel API listing failed with 403 for team scope `portable-food-bank-team`; deployment status and `/locations/` live behavior remain unverified.

## 2026-09-30 — State-directory label spacing

- Added an explicit whitespace separator between each linked state name and its listed-location count in the shared homepage/service-area directory.
- Preserved all state hrefs, counts, map behavior, and directory layout.
- `pnpm exec vitest run tests/mapLocationDirectory.test.tsx` — PASS, 1 test. `pnpm typecheck` — PASS. `git diff --check` — PASS.
- Browser and Vercel deployment checks were not run. Commit `673f264` was pushed to `Portable-Food-Bank/portable-food-bank.com` `main`.

## 2026-09-30 — Homepage kitchen-first intro copy

- Replaced the former one-line service inventory with a kitchen-led introduction: temporary commercial mobile kitchens, meal-service continuity use cases, and planning factors are described first; one concise final sentence names temporary dishwashing, refrigeration/freezer, mobile shower, shower/restroom-combination, and man-camp/workforce-housing rentals.
- Preserved the homepage H1, routes, CTAs, service cards, family distribution, and remaining page copy.
- Added an SSR assertion that the introductory paragraph has a 75–85% primary-kitchen word share. Updated responsive browser assertions for the full supporting-family names.
- `pnpm exec vitest run tests/homepagePortfolio.test.tsx` — PASS, 1 file / 5 tests. `pnpm typecheck` — PASS. `git diff --check` — PASS.
- Browser execution and full prerender were not run for this copy-only change. Commit `64f2298` was pushed successfully to `Portable-Food-Bank/portable-food-bank.com` `main`. Vercel deployment was not checked.

## 2026-09-30 — V16.3 corrected distribution and local release candidate

- Scope and identity: isolated repository `Portable-Food-Bank/portable-food-bank.com`; Vercel team/project `portable-food-bank-team/portable-food-bank-com` (`prj_4Xktb9zJ8Y39Ezh391gKoVsIoY38`). No PortableFoodBank repository, project, domain, DNS, or alias was changed.
- Baseline distribution evidence: 401 initially classified pages, 99 primary and 302 supporting (24.69% / 75.31%), with 32 commercial H1 failures. The final explicit denominator removes six operational/private routes that do not sell a commercial equipment or facility rental.
- Final generated distribution: 395 commercial pages, 324 primary and 71 supporting (82.03% / 17.97%); route-family counts are equipment/detail 144 (76 primary / 68 support), region/state 246 (246 primary), and reviewed city/industry 5 (2 primary / 3 support). All 395 commercial pages have one topical + facility + rental H1; location pages also carry location + use-case intent.
- Homepage hierarchy audit: one primary-led H1; dedicated family-specific copy measures 430 primary words versus 92 supporting words (82.38% / 17.62%) over a documented 522-word denominator. Mixed introductory copy, generic calculator controls, dynamic map content, global navigation, and the footer are excluded rather than assigned to either cohort. Desktop 1440 x 900 geometry measures 979.1875 px primary versus 244.8125 px supporting, or 80.00% primary. Mobile 390 x 844 geometry measures 680 px primary versus 217.9375 px supporting, or 75.73% primary. All five verified supporting-family names remain visible.
- `npm run typecheck` — PASS. `npm test` — PASS, 13 files / 75 tests. `node scripts/audit-v163-homepage.mjs` — PASS. `npm run build` — PASS, 664 pages plus 404. `node scripts/check-server-runtime.mjs` — PASS, four provider-initialization and request-gate safety checks.
- Generated checks — PASS: 665 HTML files, 85,330 links, 12,427 images, 664 structured-data blocks, 670 forms, and zero audit failures; link check 664 pages / zero issues; headline check 548 location pages; city check 19,702 Census places / 246 directories / 5 reviewed city pages; secret scan 1,073 files / no findings; approved release-scope check passed. One intentional draft-canonical warning remains.
- Focused local Playwright — PASS, 8/8 against a dedicated clean preview. Coverage includes desktop/mobile V16.3 geometry, H1/support copy, image loading, overflow/duplicate IDs, map keyboard behavior, fail-closed form behavior, authored routes, true 404, redirect behavior, and security headers.
- `npm run check:seo` — UNVERIFIED under current machine contention. The exhaustive checker produced no result after two attempts, including a high-memory run allowed to continue for more than one minute; it was stopped instead of being restarted again. The separate generated-output, link, headline, city, distribution, and browser checks above remain valid.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reports two moderate transitive advisories and no high/critical advisories. `npm run check:security` remains blocked by the incomplete/stale security-evidence ledger. Existing JSON-import/Zod annotation warnings and the approximately 2.98 MB / 785 KB gzip Site bundle remain. No independent second-agent review was available for this new revision.
- Release result: implementation commit `d936fe0` and evidence commit `42a46cc` are pushed to `origin/main`. `npx vercel build --prod --yes --scope portable-food-bank-team` passed for the explicitly linked project and generated 664 pages plus 404. Production deployment `dpl_EPmbX5P3VmXnPKQySEcGvTeQLVS2` reached Ready; the current alias-owning production deployment `dpl_3jZybnjUpjrrw7GBvjqdieaHtGTR` is also Ready. Focused live Playwright passes 8/8 independently on `https://portable-food-bank.com` and `https://portable-food-bank-com-theta.vercel.app`, covering desktop/mobile hierarchy, map keyboard/focus, fail-closed inquiries, authored routes, true 404, query-preserving redirect behavior, and security headers. Existing DNS, domains, and aliases were unchanged. The CLI initially inferred the worktree name and created an unused empty project `portable-food-bank-v163-20260930`; it was stopped before deployment, explicitly relinked to the correct project, and left undeleted pending separate destructive-action approval. Indexing remains disabled, the sitemap remains empty, inquiry delivery remains disabled, and no live inquiry or external indexing action was performed. Full V16.3 release certification remains blocked by the unavailable independent reviewer and the owner-approved indexing policy's conflict with the public-indexability gate.

## 2026-09-30 — Superseded pre-V16.3 whole-site release and live verification

- Scope and identity: isolated repository `Portable-Food-Bank/portable-food-bank.com`; Vercel team/project `portable-food-bank-team/portable-food-bank-com` (`prj_4Xktb9zJ8Y39Ezh391gKoVsIoY38`). The `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` repository/project/domains were not changed.
- Source state: audit/fix sequence `dc611ca`, `85850f8`, `1339d02`, `51b9f8a`, and `cdd6727` pushed to `origin/main`. The final code deployment was `dpl_EJ9Rdu1cmhDdK4Gitk9zUUmBT3j8`, built from `cdd6727`, and reached Ready.
- `npm run typecheck` — PASS. `npm test` — PASS, 13 files / 74 tests. `node scripts/check-server-runtime.mjs` — PASS, four provider-initialization and method/feature-gate safety boundaries. `npm run build` — PASS, 664 pages plus 404. `npx vercel build --prod --yes --scope portable-food-bank-team` — PASS, including Vercel's post-build serverless TypeScript checks.
- Generated checks — PASS: 665 HTML files; 85,330 static-audit links; 77,041 SEO-audit local links; 12,154 images; 664 schemas; 670 forms; 665 unique titles and descriptions; zero generated-audit failures; zero missing/case-mismatched links; 548 location headlines; 19,702 Census places, 246 directories, and 5 reviewed city pages; 1,063 secret-scanned files with no findings. One intentional warning remains for the noindex draft canonical at `/service-areas/oklahoma/panhandle/`.
- Focused local Playwright — PASS, 8/8. Final live Playwright — PASS, 8/8 independently on `https://portable-food-bank-com-theta.vercel.app` and `https://portable-food-bank.com`. Coverage includes desktop/mobile homepage acceptance and 25/75 geometry, image load/overflow/duplicate IDs, map keyboard/focus and all seven Texas region links, two quote-form islands, authored state/region/directory/industry/city routes, true 404, query-preserving 308, and baseline security headers.
- Live HTTP/API proof on both hostnames: homepage 200 with HTML `noindex`; `robots.txt` 200 with root allowed and `/api/` excluded; empty `sitemap.xml` 200 with zero URL entries; unknown route 404; POST `/api/contact.json` 503 `Inquiries are not enabled yet.`; GET `/api/deliver.json` 405 `Use POST.`; GET `/api/seo-diagnostics.json` 200 with `configured:false`. The Vercel alias also returns `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow`; the custom domain is protected by the rendered robots meta.
- Foreign-path proof: every one of the 24 non-root PortableFoodBank authority paths returns 404 with no redirect on both public hostnames. The records remain label-only historical evidence and are absent from current route/indexing/internal-link targets.
- Vercel runtime logs after live probes contain only the expected controlled 503/405 rejection events and successful diagnostics requests; no error-level entries, `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`, missing-module failure, or current function exception was recorded.
- Remaining boundaries: `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 2 moderate transitive advisories and no high/critical advisories. `npm run check:security` remains blocked by stale/incomplete 2026-09-11 evidence. An exploratory broad Vitest run still has historical debt (14 failing files / 109 failing tests; 34 passing files / 488 passing tests / 7 skipped), so only the supported designated suite is claimed green. The build retains JSON import/Zod annotation warnings and a roughly 2.98 MB / 785 KB gzip Site chunk.
- Indexing and external-action boundary: noindex remains active and the sitemap remains empty. No DNS, Search Console, indexing, analytics, external-delivery, or live-inquiry action was performed.

## 2026-09-24 — Restore missing kitchen category routes

- Added static render coverage for the preserved mobile-kitchen category slug and building-based modular-kitchen facility slug. Category copy and navigation now use /equipment-rental/mobile-kitchen-trailers/ (not the 24 ft product URL); 38 ft was linked because its existing service-detail model is already verified. The approved 24 ft gallery is explicitly described as a 24 ft model photo reference, not a gallery for every size/configuration.
- Added a standalone /modular-kitchen-facilities/ page with one H1, building-specific planning content, a cross-link to mobile trailer options, and no mismatched trailer photo. Kept the route's existing noindex,follow directive.
- node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/restoredKitchenCategoryPages.test.tsx — PASS, 2/2. pnpm run typecheck — PASS. pnpm run build — PASS, generated 101 pages + 404. Inspected both output files: expected title/H1, neither is a 404; the mobile-kitchen page has one verified gallery (10 images), modular page has no equipment gallery, and both remain noindex,follow in this preview build.
- Build emitted existing JSON import-attribute consistency and oversized-client-chunk warnings. No browser/visual verification or Vercel deployment/live check was performed. Build-registry and indexing-rollout audit artifacts were regenerated.

## 2026-09-24 — Floating contact/support CTA copy and positioning

- Updated the fixed contact tab to “Need equipment? / Talk to us” and the lower-right support trigger to “24/7 rental help / Call us.” Kept the `/contact-us/` destination, urgent-support dialog, `tel:+18885636507` link and brand palette.
- Slightly adjusted placement on desktop and mobile: contact rail vertical center from 52% to 50%, mobile rail raised by 0.25 rem; support control moved inward 4–6 px and raised 6–10 px.
- `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/floatingContactWidgets.test.tsx` — PASS, 1 file / 1 SSR behavior test. `pnpm run typecheck` — PASS. `git diff --check` — PASS (line-ending notices only).
- Responsive browser test attempt could not launch because the configured Playwright Chromium executable is absent. A first run also found the default `npm run preview` web-server command unavailable. No browser-visual pass is claimed.
- Commit `5e13741` is pushed to `origin/main`; no Vercel build/live verification.

## 2026-09-24 — Restore image-backed combination inventory routes

- Added server-rendered regression coverage for four header-visible combination routes: 12 ft and 14 ft listings show clean 13 ft / 3-stall combination reference photos; the 20 ft listing shows the 22 ft / 6-stall reference photos. Each rendered caption identifies that separate reference model and explicitly states the image does not establish the listed model's dimensions, stall count, floor plan or availability. Captions do not expose PortableFoodBank branding.
- Restored `/refrigeration-container-40ft-rental-5/` in the header with its existing illustrated 8 ft x 40 ft refrigerated-container category reference and category/availability disclosure.
- Kept `/12ft-shower/`, `/14ft-shower/`, and `/30ft-shower/` held from header inventory because the discovered image sets were not suitable shower-only references for those listed sizes. Direct URLs and directory links remain intact.
- `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/inventoryNavigationPhotoCoverage.test.tsx` — PASS, 1 file / 4 tests, including all header product destinations and complete directory links.
- `pnpm run typecheck` — PASS. `git diff --check` — PASS (line-ending conversion warnings only).
- No route slug or H1 changed. Commit `69683fb` is pushed to `origin/main`; no Vercel project is linked in this worktree, so deployment/live output remains unverified.

Release update for the inventory navigation photo-coverage check: implementation commit `e2b78ae` is pushed to `origin/main`. No Vercel build/live verification was performed.

## 2026-09-24 — Inventory header links require rendered image coverage

- Audited all 31 model/category links in `serviceCategories` against the actual server-rendered `Site` output. Eight product detail destinations produced no gallery: `/refrigeration-container-40ft-rental-5/`, `/12ft-shower/`, `/14ft-shower/`, `/30ft-shower/`, `/12ft-restroom-shower-all-in-one-trailer/`, `/14ft-restroom-shower-combo-trailer/`, `/14ft-restroom-shower-combo-trailer-2/`, and `/20ft-restroom-shower-combo-trailer-rental/`.
- Audited the supplied TSV's 670 rows. Its `Target URL` field has one unique path, `/`, so none of those product URLs has a specific spreadsheet-backed backlink destination.
- Exported a header-only filtered navigation list. The eight unpictured URLs are absent from desktop and mobile header dropdowns, while all original category/model links remain in `/equipment-rental/` and every direct URL remains served. The Dishwashing, Shower, and Restroom & Shower Combination overview actions point to their respective representative-image sections on `/equipment-rental/`.
- Regression command: `node ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/inventoryNavigationPhotoCoverage.test.tsx tests/preservedInventoryRoutes.test.tsx tests/equipmentMissingPhotos.test.tsx` — PASS, 3 files / 19 tests. Coverage asserts each held route still has no rendered gallery and is absent from header links, every remaining header route has a rendered gallery, category overview anchors have images, and the full inventory page retains all model links.
- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS. `git diff --check` — PASS (Git reports existing line-ending conversion notices only).
- Full production build and Vercel deployment/live-page verification were not run. This worktree has no `.vercel/project.json` or `.vercel/repo.json`.

## PortableFoodBank-equivalent inventory URL reachability — 2026-09-24

- Source: the supplied tab-separated backlinks export contains 670 rows; every `Target URL` is `https://portable-food-bank.com/`, so it identifies no inventory-specific path. Per owner direction, matched the three uncovered routes to the exact same product/category slugs in `public/sitemap-review.xml` (PortableFoodBank source sitemap).
- Added the two product models to their matching service-menu families and explicitly added the refrigerated-container catalog detail path to static prerender generation. The 40 ft refrigerated-container URL also existed in `service-details.json`; the route had therefore rendered as a text-only `ServiceDetail` before, rather than its catalog gallery. `ServiceDetail` now accepts that page’s catalog photo/caption data while preserving the 40 ft model H1 and the 8 ft x 40 ft category-reference disclosure.
- Focused tests: **25/25 pass** across `preservedInventoryRoutes.test.tsx`, `equipmentMissingPhotos.test.tsx`, and `serviceHeroImages.test.ts`; TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` — PASS.
- Vite production client build — PASS (existing JSON import-attribute and large-chunk warnings). Static prerender — **98 pages + 404**. Verified generated HTML files and page H1/gallery for `/equipment-rental/refrigerated-containers/`, `/services/shower-trailers/22ft-10-stall/`, and `/services/shower-restroom-combination-trailers/30ft-8-stall/`. Generated audit registry snapshots were restored after the verification build; `dist/` remains ignored output.
- `git diff --check` — PASS. Released via `origin/main`; Vercel production deployment state is not asserted from this local build.

## Portable Food Bank remaining inventory-photo gaps — 2026-09-24 (PUSHED TO origin/main; VERCEL STATUS UNVERIFIED)

- Audited all 25 catalog entries and all 33 dedicated equipment-detail routes. Filled the missing refrigerated-container detail with the existing unbranded source illustration, explicitly describing its printed 8 ft x 40 ft label as a category reference, not confirmation of Portable Food Bank's exact unit/availability.
- Added one correctly labelled 20 ft five-stall shower-only reference image to the 22 ft ten-stall shower page; its caption explicitly says it is not a photo of that 22 ft model. Left the 22 ft service-area/map selection unpictured to avoid presenting a different model as an exact match.
- Visual review confirmed the exact 30 ft eight-stall shower/restroom combination trailer exterior is photographed in a commercial equipment yard and has no visible PortableFoodBank logo or brand reference; approved its existing responsive derivatives and model-matched gallery alt text. No interior view is claimed.
- Focused SSR/image coverage: **85 passed, 1 skipped** across `equipmentMissingPhotos`, `serviceHeroImages`, `ownerPhotoBundleCoverage`, and `allPageAlignment`. This includes all homepage equipment cards, all eight inventory-family cards, all catalog entries, all 33 product-detail galleries and the no-placeholder checks. The skipped case requires an absent historical `work/qa/all-page-alignment-20260916/before.json` fixture; all catalog-image assertions and all service-detail-gallery assertions passed.
- TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` — PASS; `git diff --check` — PASS. Commit `8564719` pushed to `origin/main`. This turn did not run a complete production build or verify a deployed URL. No route, slug, H1 or canonical changed.

## Portable Food Bank service/product gallery captions and side-by-side hero — 2026-09-24 (PUSHED TO origin/main; VERCEL STATUS UNVERIFIED)

- Replaced the screenshot-visible generic equipment-reference fallback in `LocationImageCarousel`; target product, service-area, industry, equipment quick-view, represented inventory-family, Panhandle and Olympic Peninsula captions now use the shared equipment/family caption builder, and location copy keeps its location + commercial use + exact equipment + Rental or Lease lead.
- `TargetLegacyPage` renders the product/service summary, H1, intro and request/call action beside its existing gallery on desktop, and stacks them below the 860 px breakpoint. It preserves carousel/lightbox markup, approved image identities, image order, alt text, URLs and H1s.
- Dedicated `ServiceDetail` and Equipment quick-view captions now share the standard structure, approved rental-term language and Portable Food Bank verified support line; the stale `+1 (800) 443-5212` caption is no longer injected.
- Focused suite: **60/60 tests passed** across service-area caption/heading, legacy product/service model copy, inventory photo coverage, carousel ordering, owner-photo rollout, Panhandle captions/metadata and Olympic Peninsula captions. Covers every photographed legacy route, all 33 registered service details where a carousel is present, industry hero captions, represented inventory-family captions and location-page rendered caption rules.
- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS. `git diff --cached --check` — PASS. Secret pattern scan — PASS (386 files, no findings).
- In a disposable copy of the exact worktree snapshot, Vite production build passed and prerender generated 95 pages plus 404. Local browser verification confirmed the homepage and `/12ft-restroom/` render; both returned HTTP 200, and the restroom route contains its expected H1, carousel and support caption. The copy isolated the existing audit files from prerender output.
- The repository's general test command was attempted. It reported failures in legacy URL/migration expectations and seasonal-content checks (including a New Jersey 507/500 character limit); the process was interrupted before a complete run summary. Do not treat the full suite as passing. The focused caption/gallery suite remains 60/60 passing.
- Commit `2b93025` was pushed to `origin/main`. Vercel's connected team listing returned no teams and this worktree has no `.vercel/project.json`; an automatic Vercel deployment was not verified.

## Mobile Kitchen model-page family alignment and distinctiveness — 2026-09-23 (LOCAL PASS; PUSHED, VERCEL PENDING)

- Audited and rendered all 17 restored legacy product routes and all 33 `ServiceDetail` model records.
- Legacy-page SSR assertions: all preserved H1s remain single and unchanged; all 17 route leads and planning guides differ; kitchen-only meals/cooking language is absent from non-kitchen pages; the kitchen page retains kitchen-specific planning copy; the old generic planning heading is absent. A pairwise Jaccard token-overlap screen compares the page-specific copy for every route pair and flags any pair at/above the internal 0.55 review cutoff (not a Google threshold).
- Service-detail SSR assertions: all 33 records have route-specific use/planning copy, include the current model name in section headings, preserve exactly one H1, render without category-name errors, and pass the same pairwise overlap screen. Explicit family aliases cover legacy Restroom, Shower, Shower/Restroom Combination and Sleeper labels.
- The 12 ft restroom service-detail has a source-conflict disclosure and no copied fixture-count claims. The two 14 ft combination paths remain separately routable but their identity is not fabricated.
- `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/portableFoodBankTargetCopy.test.tsx` — PASS, 1 file / 7 tests after adding pairwise near-duplicate screening. Initial run exposed the legacy menu category-name mismatch; after the alias/fallback correction the suite passed.
- `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit` — PASS. `git diff --check` — PASS.
- Added a reusable category/family and distinct-model content prompt at `docs/prompts/06_CATEGORY_AND_PAGE_DISTINCTIVENESS.md`; README index updated. Its similarity thresholds are internal review flags, not claimed Google thresholds, and it forbids invented differentiators/canonical changes without approval.
- Vite production client bundle passed with existing import-attribute/chunk-size warnings; full prerender and live browser verification were not run. Commit `bb47824` was pushed to `main` and `codex/homepage-mobile-kitchen-brand`; GitHub reports Vercel pending. Google indexing outcome is external and unverified.

## Mobile Kitchen approved inventory-photo correction — 2026-09-23 (LOCAL PASS; PUSHED, VERCEL PENDING)

- Updated the Containerized Sleeper inventory image to the two approved `model-24` container photos. It no longer uses the separate April-approved two-stall sleeper-trailer interior set.
- The 12 ft, 14 ft, 20 ft and 30 ft restroom legacy pages now show the supplied restroom-only trailer set with an explicit caption that the photos do not establish each page's size, stall count or floor plan.
- Removed cross-size or unscheduled galleries from the 26 ft bulk kitchen, 12 ft refrigerated trailer, 22 ft ten-stall shower trailer, 24 ft laundry trailer, 30 ft combination trailer, and 40 ft refrigerated-container listing. The existing 40 ft refrigerated-container catalogue image is marked withheld because the owner-provided image schedule does not approve that asset for this model.
- Target-specific Playwright/Chrome verification against local built preview `http://127.0.0.1:4183`: **1/1 passed**. It checked all 16 preserved product URLs (eight with matching approved photo/reference galleries and eight with no carousel), the 26 ft kitchen's pending state, the 40 ft refrigeration route's no-photo state, the single H1 on each, and the Sleeper category's `model-24` image/alt text.
- Unit tests: **19/19 focused mapping tests passed**. TypeScript passed. `pnpm build` passed: production bundle and static prerender of **95 pages + 404** completed, with the existing JSON-import and chunk-size warnings. `git diff --check` passed.
- Release: commit `a8c76c9` was pushed to `codex/homepage-mobile-kitchen-brand`. GitHub's Vercel status reports `Vercel is deploying your app` for this commit.
- Boundary: `agent-browser` and Playwright's bundled Chromium were unavailable; system Chrome was used successfully through Playwright. The full repository Vitest run was stopped after more than two minutes without completing. Separate legacy-suite runs reported out-of-scope content/migration assertions (`allPageAlignment`, `seasonal`, `equipmentMissingPhotos`) and one older cross-size expectation was updated to match this approval boundary. The connected Vercel API tool returned 403 for this project scope, so a live deployment URL and live-page verification remain outstanding.

## Mobile Kitchen inventory restoration — 2026-09-23 (LOCAL PASS)

- `/equipment-rental/` now renders exactly eight Portable Food Bank families: Mobile Kitchens, Dishwashing, Refrigeration, Restroom Trailers, Shower Trailers, Restroom & Shower Combination, Laundry, and Containerized Sleeper Units.
- Static rendered HTML contains 28 direct model links, including the retained restroom, shower, combined, laundry, and containerized-sleeper slugs; it contains no unrelated legacy command-center, security-camera, or tent inventory.
- Category imagery resolves through the approved image registry. One reviewed family representative is shown per family; model names are text links to their exact pages so a category reference image is not represented as a different unit.
- Local browser check at `http://127.0.0.1:4174/equipment-rental/index.html` found the eight section headings, 28 model links, exactly one H1, and no browser-console errors. The inherited `PortableFoodBank equipment` introduction is absent.
- `pnpm typecheck`, `git diff --check`, production Vite build, and static prerender verification pass.
- READY Vercel preview `https://portable-food-bank-4s6f767ar-jhomar0021s-projects.vercel.app/equipment-rental/` browser verification found the eight family headings, 28 model links, one H1, corrected Mobile Kitchen introduction, and no console errors. Production deployment `portable-food-bank-bp30wxswj-jhomar0021s-projects.vercel.app` was still BUILDING when checked.

## Approved-equipment image placement — 2026-09-23 (LOCAL PASS)

- Source approval: owner-supplied Google equipment image schedule, sheet `1tu6szuEWANuI0gtqrsl9g_gQa0Vm256YD7UmsEtouOc`, inspected 2026-09-23. Its 40 ft Mobile Kitchen and Restroom Trailer entries match the approved Drive-derived derivatives already held in this repository.
- `src/Site.tsx` now references the approved responsive 40 ft Mobile Kitchen source for its direct About and kitchen-guide slots and the approved responsive Restroom Trailer source for its hygiene-guide slot. All four `.webp` derivative files exist.
- Homepage service-hero and equipment-card source audit confirms that their Mobile Kitchen, dishwashing, and refrigeration images already resolve through the reviewed `serviceHeroImages` registry rather than an unapproved direct source.
- Generic, map, logo, and no-exact-match visual slots were not replaced. No cross-model or ambiguous imagery was introduced.
- `pnpm typecheck` and `git diff --check` passed. Clean build/prerender output and static rendered-image inspection passed; deployment verification is pending.

## 2026-09-23 — Mobile Kitchen original-product URL restoration (local)

- Evidence: original homepage navigation exposed 33 non-fragment paths. Sixteen product paths were absent from the rebuild and returned the generic 404 prior to this change. The supplied backlink file contains 670 rows but only homepage targets, so it cannot provide a deeper URL inventory.
- Restoration: registered each missing exact path, restored its product family in the desktop and mobile Inventory menus, and rendered every page as a direct product page with one H1. The affected paths are documented in `docs/PORTABLE_FOOD_BANK_URL_AUDIT_2026-09-23.md`.
- Checks: `pnpm typecheck` passed; `git diff --check` passed; Vite production build completed (non-blocking existing JSON-import and bundle-size warnings only); prerender output contains all 16 paths; an output audit confirmed every restored route exists and has exactly one `<h1>`. A clean-build then prerender check also confirmed `/12ft-restroom/` contains its product H1 and does not contain the homepage H1.
- Boundary: the original site returns HTTP 403 for automated sitemap, robots, and individual-page retrieval. The verified homepage inventory is restored, but an assertion that it represents every historic URL remains pending a sitemap or CMS export. No deployment is recorded in this local entry.

## Mobile Kitchen state-landing carousel parity — 2026-09-23 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Production Vite build and static prerender passed: 79 pages plus 404. Existing JSON-import-attribute and bundle-size warnings remain non-blocking.
- Browser verification at `http://localhost:4173/massachusetts/` found exactly one H1 and the restored five-image Mobile Kitchen carousel, including prior/next controls, pause control, five thumbnail selectors, and full-image lightbox trigger. The gallery title resolves to `Massachusetts Commercial Mobile Kitchen Trailer Rental`.
- Browser verification repeated on preview `portable-food-bank-684opggao-jhomar0021s-projects.vercel.app/massachusetts/` and production `portable-food-bank-com.vercel.app/massachusetts/` after READY deployment `dpl_2mKrJPyv3aDLsJvLHLuojs9Akanj`; both have exactly one H1 and the five-image carousel with its full-image, previous/next, and pause controls.

## Shared dark-surface contrast correction — 2026-09-23 (LOCAL PASS)

- Confirmed the reported failure on the deployed site: `.services-panel-heading` was `rgb(36, 36, 36)` while its `strong` heading was `rgb(23, 23, 23)`.
- Final shared palette and the desktop homepage header selector now set that heading and its inherited foreground to white; source audit found no other retained dark-surface heading using this unsafe inherited rule.
- `pnpm typecheck` and `git diff --check` passed. Preview visual verification is pending.

## Contact-rail teal removal — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- Replaced the fixed contact rail’s inherited turquoise icon tile and pale-teal status copy with orange `#f47b20`/black and red/white values; its hover/focus shadow is now red.
- `pnpm typecheck` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Deployed preview `https://portable-food-bank-gkndhefk0-jhomar0021s-projects.vercel.app/`: computed contact-rail tile `rgb(244, 123, 32)`, icon `rgb(23, 23, 23)`, rail `rgb(185, 0, 0)`, and status copy `rgb(255, 255, 255)`; no teal remains in this component.

## Button contrast correction — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- Shared action controls now use black `#171717` text over orange `#f47b20` and white `#fff` text over red `#b90000`, per owner direction.
- `pnpm typecheck` and `git diff --check` passed. Preview verification is pending.

## Strict two-color button system — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- Final palette applies only `#f47b20` (orange) and `#b90000` (red) to solid customer-facing action-button surfaces; action text is `#fff`.
- Covered primary/secondary buttons, state/map modal actions, carousel arrows and toggle, contact-drawer actions, and mobile menu controls. Image-thumbnail buttons remain photo-based controls.
- `pnpm typecheck`, `git diff --check`, and `$env:CI='true'; pnpm build` passed. Preview verification is pending.

## Mobile Kitchen button-color normalization — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- CSS audit identified the inherited `--accent: #b63d2f` token as the source of the red state-rental CTA shown in the supplied screenshot.
- The final Mobile Kitchen palette maps primary actions and direct retained region/map CTAs to `--mk-orange`, with `--mk-orange-dark` hover/focus treatment; red remains scoped to urgent-support controls.
- `pnpm typecheck`, `git diff --check`, and `$env:CI='true'; pnpm build` passed. Preview visual verification is pending.

## State-map carousel stylesheet repair — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- Root cause confirmed from the user’s deployed screenshot and import audit: `service-hero-carousel.css` defined the required carousel layout but was omitted from `src/main.tsx`.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `$env:CI='true'; pnpm build`: passed; deployment visual verification is pending.

## Mobile Kitchen state-map gallery remediation — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `$env:CI='true'; pnpm build`: passed; existing JSON import-attribute and vendor-chunk warnings are non-blocking.
- Generated `/locations/` markup contains the `Massachusetts Commercial Mobile Kitchen Trailer Rental` verified five-image gallery, exactly one prior and one next carousel control, and no prior office/sleeper/shower gallery heading for the interactive state template.
- Deployed preview interaction check: clicking Massachusetts opened one verified five-image Mobile Kitchen carousel with one prior and one next arrow. A follow-up source scan found inherited seasonal/base-camp copy lower in the dialog; that content has been removed and requires final deployment verification.

## Complete Mobile Kitchen palette remediation — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Vite production bundle: passed (existing JSON import-attribute and large-chunk warnings remain non-blocking).
- Local browser visual review: homepage service-area map now renders orange/cream states and orange controls; closing module is charcoal with orange CTA; inherited calculator aqua panels are cream/orange. The interactive map and fixed contact rail remain present.

## Shared support-ribbon removal — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Generated `dist/index.html` contains the shared header without `.mk-live-ribbon`; the removed three-part support text has no remaining match in `src` or generated output.
- The shared `Header` component is used across routes; H1 markup and route paths were not changed.

## Screenshot-matched global header correction — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Shared route header now has the required global Portable Food Bank variables and header class; all routes receive the approved red/white/orange header system.

## Portable Food Bank-layout navigation correction — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Every route now renders the shared Portable Food Bank-layout navigation; inventory content remains Portable Food Bank-only.

## Portable Food Bank global visual-system remediation — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Shared header now uses the Portable Food Bank class on every route; global and coverage-map color tokens are red/orange/cream rather than inherited teal/blue.

## Portable Food Bank brand/render remediation — 2026-09-22 (PARTIAL LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- Vite client bundle: passed.
- Archive prerender verification: blocked locally because the combined build command did not complete its archive-output phase; preview deployment verification remains required.
- Corrected structured-data logo target exists locally at `/images/portable-food-bank-legacy-logo.webp`.

## Portable Food Bank visible-service rebrand — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `pnpm build`: passed. Existing Vite warnings remain for `calculatorCities.json` import-attribute consistency, vendor annotations, and a large Site bundle.
- Rendered-page H1 audit: **61/61** generated route documents contain exactly one `<h1>`.
- `vitest run tests/routes.test.ts tests/prerender-text.test.ts`: **6/6 passed**.
- Scope check: visible menus, category data, catalogue cards, and quote options contain only Mobile Kitchens, Dishwashing, and Refrigeration. Legacy routes remain in the project rather than being deleted.

## Service-area and calculator navigation correction — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS)

- `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build`: passed.
- Generated `/locations/`: contains the service-area H1 and `map-location-directory` map/directory component.
- Generated `/rental-calculator/`: contains the calculator H1 and `rental-calculator-form`.

## Portable Food Bank homepage brand correction — 2026-09-22 (PREVIEW LIVE; PASS)

- Scope: `src/Home.tsx`, `src/homepage.css`, and homepage-only header treatment in `src/Site.tsx`; no non-homepage page content or public slug was changed.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `pnpm build`: passed; generated 95 pages plus 404. Existing JSON import-consistency and large-chunk warnings remain non-blocking.
- Focused Vitest: `tests/routes.test.ts` and `tests/prerender-text.test.ts` passed 6/6. `tests/migration.test.ts` passed 8/11; its three failures are stale PortableFoodBank assertions for the former canonical hostname and an old Akiak redirect, not regressions from this homepage change.
- Desktop browser QA at 1280 px: exact H1 present once; brand logo loaded; zero broken images; all six kitchen-model links match preserved target slugs; red ribbon and orange header CTA computed correctly; no horizontal overflow.
- Mobile browser QA at 390×844: logo and mobile navigation render, header CTA correctly yields to the mobile menu, exact H1 remains readable, red/orange hero actions render, one H1 is present, and no horizontal overflow was found.
- React review: static model/industry/FAQ data is module-scoped, no component is defined during render, the hero image is prioritized, below-fold images are lazy, decorative card images are excluded from accessibility, and headings/actions remain semantic.
- Release: commit `8827d89` on `codex/homepage-mobile-kitchen-brand` produced Ready preview deployment `dpl_AmhJLVWv5uaBnfdQvvLAFr1WxEiN` at `https://portable-food-bank-com-git-codex-home-67f036-jhomar0021s-projects.vercel.app/`. Vercel recorded the environment as Preview and custom-domain assignment as skipped.
- Live preview browser QA: exact H1 present once, zero broken images, zero console errors, no horizontal overflow, red `rgb(185, 0, 0)` ribbon, and orange `rgb(244, 123, 32)` header CTA.

## Whole-site QA continuation — 2026-09-19 (LIVE PASS; SECURITY EVIDENCE PARTIAL)

- Isolation: all source changes and builds used `C:\Users\Charles\.codex\worktrees\whole-site-qa-origin\Portable Food Bank`; the dirty primary checkout and its unfinished 1,000-city draft were not changed or published.
- Runtime inventory: the independent browser pass covered 13 representative templates at three viewports, 39/39 presentations, plus one safe interaction flow. The dedicated equipment test covered 42 routes and 14 modal/gallery presentations at both desktop and 390 px mobile with decoded images, current captions, phone contract and zero same-origin resource errors.
- Source fixes: Contact Us breadcrumb extraction now preserves spaces across JSX line breaks; six military seals across 36 appearances and two restroom references have truthful nonempty alternatives; nine equipment pages and 12 overlapping workforce pages have route-specific metadata; the gallery browser fixture is embedded rather than depending on an absent local QA file.
- Contact selector: generated `/contact-us/` contains `Mobile Kitchen Trailers`, `Dishwashing Trailers`, `Refrigeration Trailers`, `Restroom & Shower Trailers`, `Sleeper Trailers`, `Laundry Trailers`, and `Sink Trailers`. The three broad choices and every submitted value remain unchanged.
- Automated checks: `npm test` passed **62/62**; `npm run test:rules` passed **7/7** against the isolated Firebase RTDB emulator; `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run build` generated **745 pages plus 404**.
- SEO gate: `npm run check:seo` checked 746 HTML files, 96,715 local links and 12,342 local images with **746 unique titles, 746 unique descriptions and zero problems**. The orphan rule remains strict for indexable routes and intentionally excludes nonindex utilities/staged content. The controlled rollout remains 25 indexable routes; historical recovery reports 625 of 98,253 source records and is not claimed complete.
- Crawl/content gates: `npm run check:links` passed 745 pages with zero capitalization or missing-target findings; `npm run check:headlines` passed 548/548 unique location H1s; `npm run check:cities` passed 19,702 census places, 246 region directories and five reviewed city pages; `npm run check:secrets` scanned 1,141 files with zero findings.
- Vercel domain routing: after changing `www.portable-food-bank.com` to redirect to `portable-food-bank.com`, a live audit passed **745/745** first-hop 308 redirects to the exact apex path, **745/745** final HTTP 200 responses, exact query preservation, and zero chains, loops or failures. All 25 indexable URLs passed. `/sitemap-review.xml` remains an owner-review artifact that must not be submitted, and Oklahoma Panhandle remains an intentional noindex staged exception.
- Security boundary: production dependency audit has no high/critical findings and two moderate transitive findings through Firebase Admin (`@google-cloud/storage` → `gaxios` → `uuid`). `AUTHZ`, `CORS_HEADERS`, `APP_CHECK`, `INTEGRATIONS`, `SECRETS`, `DEPLOY`, `OBSERVE`, and `RECOVERY` remain blocked until their required staging/provider evidence is collected; the security checker was not weakened.
- External-action boundary: no production form submission was made during this continuation. Prior form/Resend acceptance evidence remains valid, but inbox receipt was not rechecked.
- Release: commit `93a2a49` was pushed only to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` main. Vercel production deployment `dpl_G2ABdYFMKHF8R57gkoJztjD3pf9s` reached READY after a 2m 5s build.
- Live Contact Us: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://portable-food-bank.com npx playwright test tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts --workers=1` passed **1/1**, opening the production drawer, verifying all seven trailer labels plus the three broad choices, and selecting every unchanged submitted value.
- Live galleries: the production 42-route plus 14-modal equipment regression passed **2/2** at 1440 px and 390 px, including decoded images, current captions, phone contract and modal/lightbox behavior.
- Live metadata/routing: `/equipment-rental/sleeper-trailers/` and `/remote-workforce-house-company-in-alabama/` returned HTTP 200 with their corrected unique titles and self-canonicals. `www.portable-food-bank.com/contact-us/?qa=redirect` returned a direct 308 to the exact apex path and query.

## Contact Us trailer labels — 2026-09-19 (LIVE PASS)

- Source scope: only the Contact Us selector's visible labels changed; submitted values, `server/schema.ts`, inquiry behavior, shared service names outside the form, URLs, and indexing were preserved.
- `npx vitest run tests/contactFacilities.test.tsx`: **11/11 passed**, covering every selector label and every unchanged server-accepted value.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed and generated **745 pages plus 404**.
- Browser: the first Playwright attempt reused an unrelated stale server already listening on port 4173 and correctly failed on the old `Mobile kitchens` label. A fresh preview of this build on isolated port 4327 then passed `tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts` **1/1**, opening the actual Contact Us drawer, verifying all ten visible options, and selecting each unchanged value.
- Release: commit `a55ca90` was pushed only to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` main. Vercel production deployment `dpl_ATN5UCHnp2ujUp8AUNiU8FVsrpZH` reached READY after a 1m 43s build.
- Live browser: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://portable-food-bank.com npx playwright test tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts --reporter=line`: **1/1 passed** in 5.9s, opening the production Contact Us drawer, verifying all ten labels, and selecting every unchanged value.
- Boundary: no live inquiry was submitted because this release changes display labels only; production email delivery was not retested.

## Whole-site production-baseline QA — 2026-09-19 (LIVE PASS; RELEASE GATE PARTIAL)

- Isolation: audited `origin/main` in `C:\Users\Charles\.codex\worktrees\whole-site-qa-origin\Portable Food Bank`; the dirty primary checkout and its separate 1,000-city draft were not used or overwritten.
- Build and unit checks: `npm test -- --run` passed 56/56; `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run build` generated 745 pages plus 404.
- Crawl checks: `npm run check:links` scanned 745 pages with 0 capitalization issues and 0 missing internal targets. `npm run check:headlines` found 548 location pages and 548 unique headlines. `npm run check:cities` found 19,702 census places, 246 regional directories, five reviewed city pages and zero issues.
- Content repairs: `/temporary-facilities-2/` now permanently resolves to `/planning/`; two stale handwashing image references use an existing asset; ten migrated placeholder/file-name alts use visually verified descriptions; duplicate ADA-combination titles now include their 3-stall or 8-stall configuration.
- Dashboard runtime: headless Chromium loaded `http://127.0.0.1:4174/seo-dashboard/#workflow`, selected `Next checks`, and recorded zero console or page errors after replacing mismatched hydration with an interactive mount over the prerendered fallback.
- Secret scan: 1,107 source/built text files scanned with zero complete credential findings. A BEGIN marker alone is no longer treated as an exposed key; the scanner still requires a complete key-shaped block.
- Known release boundary: `npm run check:security` and therefore `npm run check:release` remain blocked by unresolved pre-existing security-evidence controls. The SEO report also retains legacy duplicate-title/description findings, the intentionally unlinked noindex dashboard, and an incomplete historical migration count. These results are documented, not suppressed.
- Release: commit `4f7bf1c` was pushed to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` main. Vercel deployment `dpl_HJTTMT5Ys7DHxukf5Y1zUYy3oiVV` reached READY and serves `portable-food-bank.com`.
- Production runtime: `/temporary-facilities-2/` returns a permanent redirect to `/planning/`; `/seo-dashboard/#workflow` loaded with the expected heading/tab state and zero browser console/page errors; `/sitemap.xml` returned HTTP 200.
- Indexing workbook crawl: all 327 controlled-rollout URLs returned HTTP 200. Batch 1 contains 25/25 pages with matching self-canonicals, `index,follow`, and sitemap membership. The remaining 302/302 URLs are intentionally staged with `noindex,follow` outside the sitemap. Classification issues: zero; formula-error scan: zero.
- External boundaries: Google index inclusion was not inferred from crawlability and remains `Not verified in Search Console`. Deep `www` paths can return HTTP 200 with `noindex,follow` rather than consistently redirecting to apex. Contact and quote forms were not resubmitted during this SEO verification because downstream messages are external actions and require action-time confirmation.

## Service-area gallery review-banner removal — 2026-09-18 (LIVE PASS)

- Exact scope: 648 service-area and modal presentations inventoried; 557 contained one of seven internal review context variants and were changed (477 public route presentations, 40 full-map modals, 40 compact-map modals). The remaining 91 presentations were unaffected.
- Source and generated output: exhaustive SSR passed 648/648; all 656 generated HTML files contained zero `.location-gallery-context` elements and zero cited review phrases.
- Local verification: 241/241 focused assertions, 45/45 application tests, 655-page link check, release check, and the 655-page plus 404 build passed. Browser QA passed all 12 representative desktop/mobile route presentations and all 100 state-modal presentations.
- Release: commit `68d2f6b` was pushed only to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` main. Portable Food Bank team project `portable-food-bank` deployment `dpl_7TvgbnRjjsVReBkmD55kzrm7dXkb` reached READY and was aliased to `portable-food-bank.com`.
- Production verification: the live representative page source contained zero removed banner classes and zero review phrases. Playwright repeated all 12 route presentations plus all 50 full-map and 50 compact-map modals; 3/3 suites passed.
- Preservation: customer-facing product headings and individual captions remain, as do images, truthful alt text, H1s, URLs, canonicals and indexing settings.

## Dedicated service gallery-caption correction — 2026-09-18 (LIVE PASS)

- Scope inventory: 33 dedicated service-detail routes; 13 used the generic reviewed-photo fallback and 20 already used image-specific disclosures.
- SSR and production regression: 33/33 routes contain neither `Reviewed equipment reference images` nor `Photos do not establish availability or a deployment in this location`.
- Caption acceptance: 13/13 replacements contain Commercial Project and Base Camp context, the exact page equipment name, Rental or Lease, weekly/monthly/yearly inquiry terms, a model-specific benefit/detail, and `Call us now at +1 (800) 443-5212, available 24/7.`
- Focused tests: 42/42 passed across `dedicatedServiceGalleryCopy`, `serviceHeroImages`, `ownerImageRollout`, and `equipmentMissingPhotos`.
- Application tests: 45/45 passed with `npm test`.
- Production build: passed TypeScript, Vite, and prerender; 655 pages plus 404 generated.
- Local browser QA: 26/26 desktop/mobile presentations passed across the 13 changed routes; every response was HTTP 200, each lead image decoded with truthful nonempty alt text, each caption met the acceptance checks, and zero console/page errors occurred. Evidence: `work/qa/dedicated-service-captions-20260918/browser-results.json`.
- Production browser QA: 26/26 desktop/mobile presentations passed on `portable-food-bank.com` with the same status, caption, decoded-image, alt-text, and console checks. The complete live route scan passed 33/33. Evidence: `work/qa/dedicated-service-captions-20260918/live-browser-results.json` and `live-route-results.json`.
- Release: commit `349f011` was pushed only to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` main. Vercel production deployment `dpl_HfjDn5HnFEpGvdfs81EtZWJjiBdn` is READY and verified on `portable-food-bank.com`.
- Preservation: no H1, URL, canonical, indexing directive, gallery image, or alt-text source changed.

## Equipment Rental missing-photo production release — 2026-09-18

- Scope: homepage Restroom card and the `/equipment-rental/` catalogue entries for Restroom trailers, Dining structures, both 22 ft shower trailer ten-stall entries, and Stair rentals.
- `npx vitest run tests/equipmentMissingPhotos.test.tsx tests/servicesCardPhotos.test.tsx tests/allPageAlignment.test.tsx`: 3 files passed, 65/65 tests passed. `npm run typecheck`: pass.
- `npm run build`: pass; Vite build and static generation completed for 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Existing nonfatal JSON import-attribute and Rollup annotation warnings remain.
- Local Chromium at 1440x900 and 390x844: 22/22 checks passed, including decoded images and no console or page errors.
- Production deployment `dpl_HLZTgejPHmhNHUTu3xGUqWqYi29H`: READY. Live Chromium at 1440x900 and 390x844: 26/26 checks passed across all requested catalogue cards and the homepage Restroom card, including the visible 20 ft versus 22 ft disclosure and no console or page errors.
- Live asset verification: 16/16 new responsive WebP URLs returned HTTP 200. `/equipment-rental/` returned HTTP 200 with H1 `Nationwide Temporary Facility and Equipment Rental` and the existing `noindex,follow` robots setting.
- Remaining boundary: no exact 22 ft ten-stall shower photograph exists in the repository or supplied Drive assets. The two catalogue entries therefore use the verified 20 ft five-stall shower-only reference with a visible disclosure; exact configuration and floor plan still require quote confirmation.

## Urgent Olympic caption and skill refinement — 2026-09-17

## Service-area gallery review-banner removal — local verification, 2026-09-18

- Exact resolver inventory: 648 service-area and map-modal presentations; 557 affected (477 public routes, 40 full-map modals, 40 compact-map modals) and 91 without the review paragraph. Context counts: directory 247, ADA reference 45, kitchen alternatives 54, laundry 50, man camp 56, shower reference 52, sleeper options 53.
- `npx vitest run ...`: 241/241 focused tests passed, including all 648 server-rendered presentations with zero remaining `.location-gallery-context` elements or banned review phrases. `npm test`: 45/45 passed.
- `npm run check:links`: 655 pages, zero issues. `npm run check:release`: pass. `npm run build`: 655 pages plus 404. Scan of all 656 generated HTML files found zero banner classes and zero cited review phrases.
- Playwright: 12/12 representative service-area presentations passed at 1440 px and 390 px; the full-map and compact-map suites passed all 50 states each (100/100 modal presentations). Product headings and individual captions remained present.
- Local evidence only at this entry; production deployment and live checks are pending.

- `npm run typecheck`: pass. `npx vitest run tests/olympicPeninsulaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 7/7 pass.
- Exact-route `olympic-peninsula-ssr.mjs`: three current captions with unchanged H1; pass. Local browser `olympic-peninsula-browser.mjs`: 6/6 desktop/mobile gallery checks, images loaded and no page errors.
- Repacked the same `LOCAL SKILL CHARLES_IMPORTANT.zip`: seven entries preserved, ZIP integrity and updated content byte comparison passed.
- Local preview port 4313 uses a frozen page shell with current captions inserted because concurrent work removed `dist`. Source integration passed separately; this is not a combined build or live deployment.

## Olympic Peninsula caption quality pass — local verification, 2026-09-17

- `npm run typecheck`: pass.
- `npx vitest run tests/olympicPeninsulaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 7/7 pass.
- `node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-ssr.mjs`: exact route renders all three revised captions with unchanged H1; pass.
- `node work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-browser.mjs`: 6/6 desktop/mobile gallery checks; captions present, images loaded, no page errors. Screenshots and JSON saved in the same QA directory.
- Concurrent work removed `dist` during the check. Local preview on port 4313 now falls back to a frozen page shell and inserts the current three captions; source integration was checked separately with exact-route SSR. This is a local copy preview, not a combined production build or deployment.

## Caption quality skill package — local verification, 2026-09-17

- Updated installed `portable-food-bank-portfolio-rebuild` skill and original `LOCAL SKILL CHARLES_IMPORTANT.zip` with the approved Panhandle caption example and guidance for concise, distinct, verified customer copy.
- Verified required skill frontmatter fields, preserved all seven ZIP entries, checked ZIP CRC/integrity, and byte-compared three updated package entries against the installed skill. Preserved an original ZIP backup beside the package.
- `quick_validate.py` could not start because PyYAML is unavailable in both available Python runtimes; no validator pass is claimed. No website behavior changed or deployment occurred in this task.

## Olympic Peninsula caption revision — local verification, 2026-09-17

- Charles requested unique, customer-focused descriptions and the existing "Call us now ... available 24/7" assistance CTA. Only the three exact-page captions and their tests changed; the prior Olympic Peninsula sample below is superseded.
- `npm run typecheck`: pass. `npx vitest run tests/olympicPeninsulaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 7/7 pass. `node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-ssr.mjs`: 3/3 exact-route captions with original H1 and new CTA passed.
- Restarted localhost preview at http://127.0.0.1:4313/service-areas/washington/olympic-peninsula/. Browser check at 1440/390 px: 6/6 group checks passed; tabs worked, main images decoded, new captions appeared, zero page errors. The preview uses existing prerendered markup with these three current captions inserted; no full integrated build or live check is claimed. No commit, push or deployment.

## Olympic Peninsula image-caption sample — local verification, 2026-09-17

- `npm run typecheck`: pass. `npx vitest run tests/olympicPeninsulaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 7/7 pass.
- `node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-ssr.mjs`: the exact route rendered its original H1 and all three dedicated captions in the intended equipment order.
- Local review server at http://127.0.0.1:4313/service-areas/washington/olympic-peninsula/ returned HTTP 200. `node work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-browser.mjs`: 6/6 desktop/mobile group checks passed at 1440 and 390 px; all main images decoded, tabs worked, captions had rental/lease opening and phone CTA, zero page errors. Screenshots and JSON results are in the same QA directory.
- Preview server serves the existing prerendered page with only the three current caption strings inserted and the older app bundle disabled so it cannot replace them. The exact-route SSR check separately verifies current source integration. This is a local caption review, not a full integrated build or production check. No commit, push or deployment.

## Service-area gallery copy — local verification, 2026-09-17

- `npm run typecheck`: pass. `npx vitest run tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 4/4 pass, covering single equipment, separate broad equipment groups, leasing intent, and non-location no-op.
- `node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/audit.mjs`: 548 route renders and 100 full/compact state modal templates; 648/648 presentations with zero reported caption/alt issues. 381 non-Panhandle gallery groups appear on 262 routes; 126 groups appear in 84 modal presentations. Another 284 non-Panhandle routes have no gallery. The hub's 50 inert modal templates and the existing Panhandle captions are counted in the raw 572-group report but are not new route-caption changes.
- Browser check attempted at 1440/390 px, but the local Vite server did not answer the first Alabama navigation within 30 seconds; a direct `curl -I` also received zero bytes within 10 seconds. No browser or live deployment pass is claimed. `browser.mjs` is retained as a repeatable check for a responsive server.
- No H1, URL, canonical, robots, homepage, image identity, or image-alt data source file was edited. Production behavior is not verified; no commit, push, or deployment occurred.

## Panhandle CTA correction — final local and live verification, 2026-09-17

Standard TypeScript/Vite/prerender build passed for 651 pages plus 404. Focused tests passed 209/209; application tests passed 44/44. Generated preservation audit checked 651 pages and 100 state-map presentations: zero failures, H1/intro/title/canonical/robots preserved, exactly two new captions on the Oklahoma Panhandle page. Production input delta is only src/panhandleGalleryCopy.ts.

Local and live browser runs each passed at 1440/390 px: 8 page checks, 4 product panels, 8 decoded-image displays, 4 Oklahoma map checks, zero failures or JavaScript errors. Separate 30 ft trailer and 20 ft container groups and image alt text retained. Exact rendered copy includes all three rental durations, rental/lease leading phrases and the published 24/7 phone CTA; rejected quote-confirmation disclaimers absent.

Read-only final Vercel inspection confirms READY dpl_6ykocrDRHboUz1zNH2Em9b164U5Q serves portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app. The live alias was updated by an existing release during this lane's verification; no duplicate promotion was performed. The separately observed dpl_JBnwQgnt5e7vwV6Zd8MMgca8vkHR URL requires authentication and is not treated as successful public verification. Complete remote-source fingerprint equivalence is not claimed.

Initial raw caption assertion failed because the existing prerender normalizes punctuation and telephone formatting. Rendered expectations were corrected; no runtime change was made to satisfy that harness issue. Historical failed assertions and cached-CLI lookup failure are retained. Exact evidence and visual-review limitations: work/qa/panhandle-lease-20260917/cta-final/REPORT.md, audit.json, local-browser.json, live-browser.json, release-reconciliation.json and alias-final.log.

## Panhandle laundry captions and metadata — local verification

- Build/typecheck passed; generated 651 pages plus 404.
- Two new focused tests passed. Laundry gallery regression run passed 108 tests (54 current tests plus a 54-test archived copy discovered by Vitest).
- Local browser: one canonical to https://portable-food-bank.com/service-areas/oklahoma/panhandle/; robots noindex,follow preserved; both revised rental captions present; Service schema uses laundry trailer and laundry container rental, with Panhandle/Oklahoma areaServed.
- Trailer main image loaded; container main image loaded after selecting its product tab. JSON-LD parsed successfully. No image assets or ordering changed.
- No deployment performed by this task. Full SEO audit launched separately; completion is not claimed here.

## 2026-09-17 — Latest shared-tree production-alias release

- Deployment `dpl_DqJgJTcMxMUKE7CUeAFX26jwXCNx` READY; immutable URL https://portable-food-bank-mxikekck8-cc-devs.vercel.app; existing alias https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app.
- Vercel build passed: TypeScript, Vite, 651 static pages plus 404. Existing import-attribute/annotation warnings remain non-fatal.
- Targeted H1/description suite: 91 passed. Local typecheck passed.
- Live homepage, equipment-rental, Port Angeles and SEO dashboard returned 200. Inventory HTML contains the updated equipment rental introduction. All retained noindex, follow.
- Existing calculator Playwright tests stopped on ambiguous State label selectors (also match City placeholder); no app fix inferred from this test defect. Independent live browser checks using exact select names passed on homepage and rental-calculator: Washington/Port Angeles selection, mobile-kitchen 25ft estimate $6,490 with valid dates, state change clears city, Alaska/Anchorage selection.
- Recursive secret scan did not complete and was stopped; no successful secret-scan claim. No full-site runtime, contact delivery, provider credentials or Google indexing verification performed in this release task.

## 2026-09-17 — City dropdown production-alias verification

- Existing CC Devs/portable-food-bank deployment `dpl_DE5mTkuYS9bnLzcL3T11L9fNbKqB`, immutable URL https://portable-food-bank-ad2vteq2m-cc-devs.vercel.app, aliased to https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app.
- Vercel build passed: 651 pages plus 404, draft/noindex retained. Existing non-fatal import/annotation warnings remain.
- Live Playwright `calculator-city-dropdown.spec.ts`: 2 passed (30.1s), homepage and `/rental-calculator/`. All 50 states match source city options; 19,523 distinct state-city pairs in supplied dataset. City disabled before state selection, no free-text city input, prior city cleared on state change, new city selectable.
- `.vercelignore` excludes local QA/work and old build folders; no files deleted. These tests do not certify unrelated dashboard, contact, or gallery behavior.

### 2026-09-16 — Actual multifunctional placements in existing man-camp galleries (LOCAL)

- Scope: two substitutions inside existing photo groups on 42 dedicated location pages and seven states in each map (14 modal presentations). Group count stays three; third shower-only set, standalone products, April exceptions, laundry clarity and removed hub/directory/category additions are preserved.
- TypeScript, formatting and JavaScript syntax passed. 227 focused tests passed (43 new placement checks); 44 application tests passed with 30s timeout / one worker. Production build: 651 pages plus 404, with existing non-fatal import/annotation warnings.
- 36 Playwright tests passed on the frozen 4209 build. Every affected page/modal checked at 1440px and 390px: 112 presentations and 224 full-image displays with correct product title, caption, alt, original 1434x1097 source, object-fit contain and close behavior. All 100 map modal presentations exercised in the general regression suite. No recorded page errors, failed same-origin images or unexpected contact sends.
- Exhaustive current-source/render/HTTP audit: 548 service-area URLs + 100 modals, 648 PASS / 0 FAIL. Gallery groups remain isolated, deduplicated and interior-before-exterior within each product. 75 assigned asset paths returned 200; six new original/responsive responses byte-matched local files. 247 navigation routes intentionally have no image section; 38 modular-kitchen pages remain pending.
- Existing H1s and text outside the galleries compared unchanged against this task's preflight source baseline. Existing route inventory retained. Original image manifest, bytes/model identities, release settings and all unrelated photo assignments preserved. Actual source edits: content/equipment-photo-policy.json, content/equipment-photo-additions.json, src/LocationImageCarousel.tsx; new tests: multifunctionalPlacement.test.tsx and browser/multifunctional-placement.spec.ts.
- Candidate: .temp/multifunctional-placement-20260916/dist at http://127.0.0.1:4209. Base main HEAD 8ad98dba33ef6d9b7b1e64028da3fc639bd7fd9a, uncommitted. Scoped source fingerprint f25c4a3cd33efe24fdd8ebc44e0df4ff0b50a6b63dd35807d4cfeeeed8fd15ca. Full exact inventory/hashes/evidence: audit/multifunctional-placement-2026-09-16/; screenshots/logs: work/qa/multifunctional-placement-20260916/.
- Boundary: later concurrent Equipment.tsx, main.tsx, stateGuides.ts and service-details.json corrections were inspected and preserved, not overwritten or folded into this frozen candidate. Their combined root runtime is unverified by this task. No commit, push, deployment or live-QA claim. Non-Chromium/native-device acceptance remains separate.

### 2026-09-16 — Two new multifunctional source images, preparation stage (LOCAL)

- Fully enumerated both new public Drive folders; downloaded all two PNGs, 1434x1097 each, 4,693,898 bytes total; no pagination, omitted images or decoding failures. Original receipts and SHA256 evidence: work/drive-assets-new-2026-09-16/manifest.json and work/qa/new-equipment-photos-20260916/recheck-all.json.
- Added explicit source batch, two isolated models and exact-title matching, original public copies and four responsive WebP files. All previous 154 image-use records and previous model data compare unchanged.
- Source-stage final TypeScript/production build passed (651 pages plus 404), 184 focused tests and 44 application tests passed. Four isolated component browser presentations (two products at 1440/390px) passed for original resolution, uncropped image, product title/caption/alt, Escape/close and no recorded console/network errors. An initial missing lightbox product label was fixed only for the two new IDs; initial/final logs retained.
- These fixtures are NOT live website placement QA. The initial 651-title/100-modal comparison found no exact destination and made zero existing assignment changes. Later Man Camp group selection is a separate placement revision, so preparation-stage fingerprints must not be used to claim its acceptance. Its current evidence directory is audit/multifunctional-placement-2026-09-16/.
- Separate concurrent stateRentalOption helper extraction was preserved and its exact diff reviewed; all 651 generated H1 strings remained equal. No commit, push, publication, new page/photo section or indexing change in source preparation.

### 2026-09-16 — Laundry gallery identity and grouped-audit correction (LOCAL ONLY)

- Candidate: .temp/laundry-clarity-20260916/dist, http://127.0.0.1:4207. Base main HEAD 8ad98dba33ef6d9b7b1e64028da3fc639bd7fd9a; image changes uncommitted, no deployment. Exact source fingerprint and per-file hashes: audit/laundry-clarity-2026-09-16/summary.json.
- Confirmed all 50 cited laundry-unspecified records: 36 pages and seven states in two maps. Kept the same four source images, split as model-08 trailer (08.01) and model-06 container (06.01/02/03). Strengthened captions and full-image product identity; corrected inaccurate single-model report wording with explicit per-product imageGroups.
- Final TypeScript, formatter and JS syntax checks passed. 164 focused tests passed, including all 50 concrete flagged rows. An initial tuple-type issue in the new test prevented the first build; fixed explicit tuple typing and reran successfully. Initial/final evidence retained rather than claiming the first run passed.
- Application suite: 44/44 passed, one worker and 30-second timeout. Production compilation/prerender: 651 pages plus 404, draft/noindex; existing nonfatal build warnings remain.
- Chromium: 34/34 tests passed. All 50 targets at both 1440px and 390px produced 100 recorded presentations and 400 original-image checks. Tested product headings and reference captions, exact image alt/source, single-product navigation/wraparound, uncropped contain layout, close/keyboard/reset/stale-label behavior. Visually reviewed four desktop/mobile lightbox screenshots. Existing full/compact maps, carousel, layout-scope and calculator regression cases passed.
- Exhaustive local acceptance: 548 routes + 100 state-modal presentations, 648 PASS and 0 FAIL; no broken assigned images. H1, title, metadata, canonical, robots and sitemap checks passed. Coverage unchanged: 263 pictured pages, 247 deliberate no-image layouts, 38 actual placeholders and eight held states.
- Baseline comparison verified all image identity/status/order/source records unchanged apart from alt 08.01. Old port-4205 Service Areas HTML and served carousel JS remain byte-identical. The removed unsolicited hub, directory and generic category sections remain absent.
- Two concurrently edited non-image source files differ from the frozen candidate: directory intro spacing (CityDirectoryPage.tsx), and existing-city guide link labels (regionGuides.tsx). Exact diffs/hashes recorded, not overwritten; combined runtime validation of those edits is separate. All current image-lane files match this tested candidate. No live/CDN or Safari signoff claimed.
- Evidence: audit/laundry-clarity-2026-09-16/acceptance.json, acceptance.csv, laundry-50-rows.json, laundry-browser.json and summary.json. Logs: work/qa/laundry-clarity-20260916/. Old audit wording errata: audit/image-placement-revert-2026-09-16/LAUNDRY_AUDIT_ERRATA.md.

### 2026-09-16 — Services card photo corrections (local only)

- Visually inspected source assets and selected actual commercial dishwashing machine, shower-only stall, mobile laundry machines, and handwashing sink trailer photos for the four existing cards. No layout, copy, route or homepage-override changes.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed. `npx vitest run tests/servicesCardPhotos.test.tsx`: 2/2 passed for `/services/` and `/equipment-rental/`, including responsive sources, alt text and asset existence.
- Chromium at 390px: rendered the Services page with `Site` SSR markup against local Vite asset serving; all four card images selected their 480w source and decoded successfully. Direct Vite `/services/` navigation returned an empty root because this app expects generated prerender HTML; this check does not establish a complete production-page browser pass.
- No production build or live deployment in this task. Existing frozen review builds were not altered. Live Vercel imagery remains unverified until a coordinated release.

### 2026-09-16 — Revert unsolicited photo sections; preserve approved image updates

- Frozen local build: .temp/image-placement-revert-20260916/dist, http://127.0.0.1:4205. No Vercel deployment or live QA claimed.
- Runtime delta limited to Site.tsx, CityDirectoryPage.tsx and ApprovedEquipmentPhotoOptions.tsx. Site.tsx matches its task-start backup with ONLY the unused import and extra hub gallery removed. CityDirectoryPage.tsx matches base HEAD after line-ending normalization. Image manifest, policy, resolver, equipment image assignments and carousel/map controller fingerprints match the frozen build; no drift.
- Typecheck, production build (651 routes plus 404), 110 focused image/ordering/placement tests and 31 browser tests passed. All 246 directories received a static layout assertion; desktop/mobile map hero inspected visually. Browser suite opens all 100 state modal presentations, verifies state cleanup/lightboxes and retains April's specific inside-only container/all-five trailer/two-stall sleeper decisions.
- Application suite initially recorded 43 passes and one 15-second timeout in the existing source-archive consolidation test. No assertion or application code was changed. Full serial rerun with a 30-second timeout passed 44/44; that test completed in 5.7 seconds. Both logs retained.
- Fresh exhaustive route/modal audit: 648 PASS / 0 FAIL; 548 routes with 263 picture-bearing pages, 247 intentionally without a photo section, 38 photo placeholders; all 100 state-modal presentations included. No broken assigned paths. H1/title/meta/canonical/robots/sitemaps preserved against audit baseline. Intentionally absent navigation imagery is NOT a photography gap.
- Evidence: work/qa/image-placement-revert/{unit-tests.log,app-tests.log,app-tests-final.log,build.log,browser.log,route-audit.log,final-summary.log,map-hero-1440.png,map-hero-390.png}; audit/image-placement-revert-2026-09-16/{summary.json,acceptance.csv,acceptance.json}. Earlier 4201 and later ordering snapshots were not rebuilt by this task.

## 2026-09-16 — Exhaustive physical-view ordering follow-up

- Request: recheck every assigned carousel for interior-before-exterior; preserve photo identities, families, captions and held cases; create a new frozen build/handoff without commit, push or deployment.
- Visual findings: all 113 distinct assigned full-image paths inspected via ten fresh numbered contact sheets, with the two disputed originals also opened directly. model-21 21.04/21.08 show externally accessible sink banks; model-10 10.06 shows exterior doors/wheels/steps; 10.05 shows the actual shower/toilet interior despite an entry-steps filename. Their rendered order was already physically correct. One other existing handwashing hero was incorrectly labelled detail/Interior detail and now correctly says exterior. No image bytes, assignments, categories, captions or alt descriptions were changed.
- Source: shared pure ordering helper and renderer guard; resolver/service ordering consolidated; generated manifest v4 canonicalized per model and actual view with every prior image/model record preserved by ID. Added independent hash-pinned visual-view audit, permutation/direct-render unit checks and browser ordering checks.
- Frozen target: .temp/image-order-followup-20260916/dist; http://127.0.0.1:4203. Original 4201 output/old handoff retained; all 548 old Service Areas HTML hashes still match.
- Passed: TypeScript/build (651 pages plus 404, draft/noindex); 99 focused tests; 44 application tests; 32 Chromium browser tests; Prettier and git diff whitespace checks. The added browser sweep exercised all 100 state modal presentations and 28 distinct assigned sequences through complete-image lightboxes. Existing browser regression covers autoplay, reset/cleanup, keyboard/focus, mobile/desktop and reduced motion. An initial browser discovery run lacked the required Node JSON import attribute in the new test; that test-only import was fixed and the complete 32-test run passed. Runtime build/source remained unchanged during that test fix; both logs retained.
- Independent rendered-output/HTTP audit: all 651 registered routes fetched; 1,276 individual assigned carousels / 5,280 slide instances checked by physical-view evidence, not filename or imported resolver results. Service Areas subset: 548 pages + 100 modal presentations, 1,250 carousel groups, 5,169 slides. All passed. Zero effective sequence changes were necessary; one view label corrected. All 256 original/responsive asset responses matched old frozen bytes. Captions, selections, family/model identity, alt text, held fallbacks, H1/title/meta/canonical/robots/sitemaps remained unchanged. Existing service-area regression also passed 648/648 with no broken images.
- Coverage holds: 38 Service Areas pages / eight states unchanged; 108 approved and 46 withheld manifest use records unchanged. ADA/sleeper/refrigeration reference limitations remain. Native iOS/non-Chromium and live deployment not tested by this follow-up.
- Evidence: audit/image-order-followup-2026-09-16/HANDOFF.md, summary.json, assigned-slide-order.csv, all-assigned-gallery-order.csv, route-modal-inventory.csv, visual-view-review.json, browser-view-order-evidence.json, files-and-revision.json and service-area-regression-summary.json. Logs: work/qa/image-order-followup-20260916/.
- Revision: branch main; unchanged base HEAD 8ad98dba33ef6d9b7b1e64028da3fc639bd7fd9a; uncommitted ordering revision fingerprint f2270831321d02243f6778d4a27559f6a3b6d1d0f16d2fcd4ab07bd712d13c98. No commit, push, deployment, indexing change, inquiry submission or Vercel project creation.

## 2026-09-16 — Independent frozen-4201 image QA acceptance reported by coordinator

- Evidence source: the QA coordinator's latest direct message in this conversation. These are the coordinator's independent results, not a newly executed test run by the image implementation task.
- Reviewed target: `.temp/owner-image-rollout-20260916/dist`, served on port 4201; identity and inventories in `audit/image-update-qa-handoff-2026-09-16/HANDOFF.md`.
- Reported result: 648/648 Service Areas route/modal presentations matched the handoff inventory; 5,169 slide instances, interior-before-exterior ordering, captions/held fallbacks, 77 asset responses, and mobile/desktop samples checked; no definite wrong-family image mismatch. Do not equate slide instances with unique source photographs.
- Retained caveats: 38 modular-kitchen photo-held pages and the ADA, sleeper and refrigeration reference-evidence limits remain correctly labelled. This acceptance does not provide missing photos or validate previously unproven specifications.
- Status: image implementation and scoped independent frozen-build QA complete. Deployment and independent live QA remain separate pending stages; no new Vercel release is performed by this acknowledgment.
- Read-only confirmation at acknowledgment: branch `main`, base HEAD `8ad98dba33ef6d9b7b1e64028da3fc639bd7fd9a`; image changes remain uncommitted. Both root and snapshot manifest SHA-256 match `b2dd5c5c6b5bd2d6194421d9d583a8bdddeac914a512d80eda8dc72331fdcd57`; both policy hashes match `a6d254484922a68e1f1974a6d2f6952e84091625fc07005f7e143efd8ef070ad`. These match the handoff.
- Release boundary: preserve the accepted frozen build and original handoff. A later coordinated release must use the EXISTING portable-food-bank-nine Vercel project (no new project), record its source revision, immutable deployment URL and deployment ID, verify the alias points to that revision, and hand that exact URL to the independent reviewer for live QA. A passing build or an HTTP 200 alone is not live acceptance.

## 2026-09-16 — Owner-delegated available-photo rollout

- Scope: all 548 Service Areas routes, full and compact map presentations for all 50 states, named service/category reference additions and shared multi-gallery controls. Exact April refrigeration and two-stall rules preserved.
- Isolated compiled snapshot: .temp/owner-image-rollout-20260916; local HTTP http://127.0.0.1:4201. Other in-use dist folders were not rebuilt.
- Passed: TypeScript; 94 image/policy/component tests; 44 app tests (15-second timeout, two workers); production compilation/prerender for 651 pages plus 404; 29 Chromium browser tests; all 648 route/modal audit records at 08:48 UTC. No assigned broken image paths; H1/title/meta/canonical/robots/sitemap comparisons unchanged.
- Browser scope: 100 opened state presentations, every assigned modal image decoded, separate labelled equipment groups, state switching/reset/cleanup, unique carousel IDs with page and dialog open, complete-image lightbox, desktop/mobile layout, keyboard/focus, reduced motion, April refrigeration and calculator regressions. Visual screenshots reviewed at 1440px and390px.
- Coverage: 510 pages show suitable photos or disclosed references; 38 modular-kitchen pages still use the truthful placeholder. 42 of50 states have images; eight remain pending. Generic catalogue references do not establish exact physical/ADA specifications.
- Prettier and git diff whitespace checks passed. Existing non-fatal JSON import and vendor Rollup annotation warnings remain. No dedicated lint script is configured.
- Evidence: work/qa/owner-image-rollout/ command logs and screenshots; audit/owner-image-rollout-2026-09-16.csv, .json and -summary.json. Earlier historical results are retained separately. An initial report-copy helper used the wrong output basename; the audit itself passed and its actual output was preserved under the new report name.
- Publication: no commit/deployment/indexing/inquiry action by this task; independently validated local compilation only. Coordinator must validate the exact combined revision and live output before publication claims.

Record meaningful verification here. Do not record a check as passed unless it was actually run.

### 2026-09-16 — Independent CEO-level Service Areas image and SEO audit

- Scope: Read-only website/source audit; separate new audit artifacts, no implementation or deployment changes.
- Environments: Fresh isolated current-source production build; live public Vercel preview at portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app; six canonical-domain paths probed separately.
- Evidence: 548 generated Service Areas routes reconciled with the registry and checked live (548 HTTP 200). Every actual image src, original lightbox path, responsive srcset, label, source hash, family and single-model association was independently checked rather than simply accepting the resolver output.
- Observed matching: 150 pages have correct photo sets. Another 73 have a safe pending state for missing ADA/modular-kitchen photography; 325 have a safe pending state requiring a title/image-policy decision. Placeholder safety is not photography completion.
- Browser: All 50 states in full Service Areas and compact mobile homepage maps (100 presentations) opened, navigated and cleared correctly. All assigned modal slides decoded. Twenty-two representative page visits at 1440/390px passed. State switching/reset, native uncropped lightbox layering/keyboard/focus/close, real 5.5-second autoplay, interaction pause and reduced motion passed. Zero recorded page exceptions, failed same-origin image requests or unexpected contact submissions.
- Assets/tests: 17 distinct displayed source photos visually rechecked; 51 live original/derivative files matched local bytes; 153 manifest source/catalog hashes rechecked. Seventy-four focused image/component tests and a fresh 651-page-plus-404 production build passed.
- SEO/release: All 548 preview routes remain noindex with no canonicals. The Vercel preview now contains the corrected imagery, but this audit did not deploy it or establish deployment identity. Canonical /service-areas/, Port Angeles and Tacoma returned 404; sampled Alabama/California/Texas paths returned 301. Regional production og:image generation still references legacy region.image and needs release review. No indexing results, traffic uplift, authority metrics or Core Web Vitals measurements claimed.
- Remaining content concerns: 40 shower-heading pages use a reviewed 20ft/five-stall reference set alongside supporting references to the 22ft/ten-stall option; explicit model context should be clarified. Thirty-nine sleeper pages have one matching exterior but no verified corresponding interior. No non-Chromium/native-iOS coverage.
- Artifacts: docs/phase1/SERVICE_AREA_CEO_AUDIT_2026-09-16.md; audit/service-area-ceo-audit-2026-09-16.csv (1,296 local/live records); audit/service-area-ceo-photo-needs-2026-09-16.csv; audit/service-area-ceo-audit-2026-09-16-summary.json; audit/service-area-ceo-browser-2026-09-16.json; work/qa/service-area-ceo-audit-20260916/.

### 2026-09-16 — Exhaustive Service Areas image and carousel acceptance

- Owner/task: Charles urgent Service Areas image task.
- Environment: Current local project, initial clean main baseline 923d3f477f71c2229c5f65089f1872dad59a0396. Production compilation/prerender was isolated in .temp/sa-image-validation because the shared root had concurrent contact/SEO work. Exact preview tested: http://127.0.0.1:4197. No deployment, commit, push, domain change or Search Console action by this task.
- Scope: All 548 dedicated service-area routes; all 50 state modals in both the full service-area map and compact homepage map (100 presentations); shared carousel and full-image lightbox; representative desktop/mobile pages; calculator and existing service-carousel regressions.
- Image review: Visually examined all 149 equipment-drive images and 4 existing catalog references. The pinned manifest contains 153 classifications, with 97 approved and 56 withheld. Generated 194 responsive WebP variants totaling 21,179,990 bytes. All 153 original source hashes were checked. Model ambiguity, exact/near duplicates, unsupported backgrounds and wrong form factors are recorded, not inferred away.
- Commands/checks: npm run typecheck; scoped npx prettier --check; node --check public/service-hero-carousel.js; npm test -- --testTimeout=15000 --maxWorkers=2; npx vitest run tests/locationCarouselImages.test.ts tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts --maxWorkers=2; npm run build in the isolated snapshot; Playwright service-area-images.spec.ts, service-hero-carousel.spec.ts and calculator.spec.ts with one worker and the explicit preview URL; node --import tsx scripts/audit-service-area-images.ts with the exact build/URL; npm run check:secrets; git diff --check.
- Observed results: TypeScript, formatting, JS syntax and whitespace checks passed. All 44 application tests and 74 image/carousel unit tests passed. Production compilation/prerender generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. All 23 Chromium browser tests passed, including every state in both map contexts, state switching and reset, complete-image desktop/mobile lightboxes above the expanded map/state dialogs, Tab/Escape/Arrow/Home/End, outside close, thumbnails, swipe versus vertical gestures, autoplay/manual pause and reduced motion. No page exceptions, console errors, failed same-origin assets or unexpected inquiry POSTs were recorded in the Service Areas acceptance browser evidence.
- Exhaustive audit: 648/648 rows PASS: 548 served page URLs plus 100 state-modal presentations. Every service-area route returned HTTP 200; assigned original/derivative paths had no failures. The independent generated-file/registry reconciliation, exact title/family/model mapping, source-hash uniqueness, interior-before-exterior order, unchanged H1/title/head metadata/canonical, route universe, robots and official/review sitemap checks passed. Browser evidence is bound to the audited HTML/controller/manifest fingerprint. A PASS may be the required truthful no-photo state; it is not evidence that missing photographs exist.
- Result counts: 301 former pooled page mappings corrected. Fifty fixed mixed state galleries replaced, with the same title-driven selection added to the compact map. 150 pages show matching photography; 398 pages and 27 states intentionally show the requested pending state. Missing-page breakdown: 289 unspecified/generic titles, 36 laundry titles without trailer/container distinction, 38 modular-kitchen titles without matching modular imagery, 35 ADA-combination titles without verified ADA assets.
- Defects found and corrected during this task: An initial native-lightbox Tab sequence could leave the dialog, so bounded Tab/Shift+Tab navigation was added and retested. Legacy absolute-position caption styling intercepted mobile thumbnail taps; the gallery caption now has a scoped static layout and taps pass. The static audit was corrected to parse inert template content as a fragment rather than misreporting it as absent. These were not waived.
- Test maintenance: The state editorial-length assertion now excludes gallery controls/pending UI while retaining its original 250–500-word editorial limit; no page copy was changed for the test. The archived-source fingerprint test exceeded its original five-second default under load, so the full application suite was rerun unchanged with a recorded 15-second timeout and two workers. The isolated snapshot was moved under excluded .temp so normal test discovery does not execute stale duplicate tests from a work folder. Existing carousel assertions were adapted to native-dialog focus and the requirement that Play resumes after interaction ends, not while still focused/hovered.
- Security check: The existing pattern scanner checked 2,104 source/built-text files with no findings. This is not a cloud IAM or full credential audit; credential files were not opened for this task. Existing JSON import-consistency, third-party Zod annotation and terminal color-environment warnings remain non-fatal and are not claimed fixed.
- Pass/fail: PASS for this local image workstream and its measured acceptance boundary. The shared project release gate remains separate; do not mark live production complete from these local results.
- Remaining unverified boundary: Production/Vercel/CDN output after deployment; native mobile browsers and engines other than the exercised Chromium build; missing or ambiguous photography/configuration evidence; unrelated active workstreams and provider/intake/indexing integrations. No live deployment URL or post-deployment test is claimed.
- Artifacts: audit/service-area-images-2026-09-16.csv, the paired JSON and summary JSON, audit/service-area-image-classification.csv, content/verified-equipment-images.json, audit/service-area-image-source-inventory.json, audit/service-area-images-baseline-2026-09-16.json.gz, docs/phase1/SERVICE_AREA_IMAGE_AUDIT.md, and command/browser/screenshot evidence under work/qa/service-area-images/.

### 2026-09-16 — Owner-visible SEO dashboard MVP

- Owner/task: Urgent PortableFoodBank workstream — owner-visible SEO dashboard
- Environment and URL: Local production build and static preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/seo-dashboard/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Display the imported Top 25 authority URLs as protected exact targets; distinguish exact slug, HTTP/redirect, canonical, sitemap, content restoration, proposed-title approval, testing, internal-link, Google verification/indexing/submission, portfolio readiness, and domain-authority evidence without inventing third-party results
- Commands/checks performed: `npx vitest run tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm test`; `npm run build`; isolated final `npx vite build --outDir dist-seo-dashboard-validation --emptyOutDir`; local HTTP request to the prerendered dashboard; headless Chromium at 1440 x 900 and 390 x 900
- Observed result: Four dashboard tests and all 44 existing application tests passed. TypeScript passed. The full Vite/prerender build generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. The dashboard returned HTTP 200 and contained the prerendered dashboard heading and authority register. Chromium rendered 25 protected-URL rows and 25 Google-status rows at both viewports, preserved the unauthenticated-access warning, and measured no page-level horizontal overflow. After the final display-only 651-page counter was added, its SSR test and isolated client build passed; a repeat build to `dist` could not empty a directory held by the already-running shared preview server (`ENOTEMPTY`), so that process was not terminated. The isolated build output was removed after validation.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the local read-only dashboard MVP and its evidence-labeling boundary
- Remaining unverified boundary: The route is not authenticated and must not hold confidential exports or credentials. Search Console property access, URL Inspection/index status, submission history, Moz/Ahrefs live checks or APIs, approved new titles, internal-link crawl results, historical-content comparisons, additional portfolio domains, production-domain behavior, and owner acceptance remain unconnected or unknown. The builds retained existing JSON import-consistency and third-party Zod annotation warnings. No deployment was performed.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/SeoDashboard.tsx`; `src/authorityTop25.ts`; `src/seo-dashboard.css`; `tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`; `audit/phase1-top-25-authority-urls.csv`; `audit/all-pages-sitemap-summary.json`

### 2026-09-15 — Rental calculator location-field refinement

- Owner/task: Temporary Kitchen 123 — calculator refinement
- Environment and URL: Local production build; `/` and `/rental-calculator/`
- Change or requirement tested: Separate state, city, and ZIP inputs; published equipment and delivery calculations; stable calculator H1; readable city/state HTML; mobile-width overflow
- Commands/checks performed: `npm test`; `npm run build`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/calculator.spec.ts`; direct `cityPages` data count
- Observed result: 41 automated tests passed; TypeScript/Vite build and static generation for 650 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 completed; 3 calculator browser tests passed; the source data contains 19,702 cities across all 50 states; the 390-by-844 calculator route had no horizontal overflow; an invalid four-digit ZIP failed browser validity and a five-digit ZIP passed
- Pass/fail: Pass for the assigned location-field refinement and tested calculator behavior
- Remaining unverified boundary: This task did not deploy. The current form calculates locally and does not submit or store a quote request, so the combined `Get Starting Estimate / Request Quote` behavior is not fully implemented. Build warnings about inconsistent JSON import attributes and third-party Zod comment annotations remain outside this assignment.
- Evidence or artifact: `tests/calculator.test.ts`; `tests/browser/calculator.spec.ts`; generated `dist/rental-calculator/index.html`

### 2026-09-15 — Mobile Dishwashing Trailer WordPress 404 audit

- Owner/task: WordPress 442 URL repair
- Environment and URL: External production site, `https://mobile-dishwashing-trailer-facility-rental.com/`; read-only public proxy where direct origin access was unavailable
- Change or requirement tested: Reproduce reported 404s, inventory published sitemap URLs, verify representative live/404 behavior, and establish backup/admin prerequisites before repair
- Commands/checks performed: Public homepage/robots/sitemap retrieval; parsed `page-sitemap1.xml` through `page-sitemap11.xml` and `resources-sitemap.xml`; sampled first/middle/last URL per sitemap; tested a deliberately nonexistent URL; DNS resolution; TCP 80/443 checks; in-app browser request to WordPress admin
- Observed result: 31,159 unique listed URLs. Of 36 representative URLs, 21 returned live page content, 15 were proxy-throttled with 429, and 0 of the successful fetches returned 404. A deliberately nonexistent URL returned the site's 404 response. Direct origin/admin connections timed out.
- Pass/fail: Blocked; public audit evidence collected, but the reported 442 URLs were not available and production prerequisites were unmet
- Remaining unverified boundary: Exact affected URLs and categories; WordPress settings/themes/plugins/logs; restorable files-and-database backup; repair; exact-set post-fix recrawl
- Evidence or artifact: `docs/wordpress-404-audit-2026-09-15.md`

### 2026-09-15 — Calculator-only action and optional exact-quote release

- Owner/task: Temporary Kitchen 123 — calculator quote submission
- Environment and URL: Local production build and live production at `https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/` and `/rental-calculator/`; current deployment `dpl_J7uvvuU7BA8LLTQWoNW2d1gvGWzS`
- Change or requirement tested: Separate calculator-only and exact-quote actions; required contact consent; deterministic equipment/delivery result; separate state, city and optional ZIP; static city HTML; mobile overflow; production intake readiness
- Commands/checks performed: `npm test`; `npm run build`; local and live `npx playwright test tests/browser/calculator.spec.ts`; one headless live calculation with network-request counting; one clearly labeled fictional QA quote attempt; one valid-shaped direct API boundary probe; temporary `CONTACT_ENABLED=true` deployment followed by safe rollback and redeployment
- Observed result: 44 automated tests passed. TypeScript/Vite build and static generation for 650 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 completed. All 4 calculator browser tests passed both locally and on the current production alias. The live Port Angeles mobile-kitchen example produced `$6,490`, displayed that no contact information was sent, and made zero `/api/contact` requests. The fictional exact-quote attempt stopped before an API request because the deployed client lacks usable Firebase/App Check configuration; a direct valid-shaped API probe returned HTTP 503. No inquiry was saved or emailed. `CONTACT_ENABLED` was restored to `false`, and the production UI now visibly disables the exact-quote action while keeping the calculator available.
- Pass/fail: Pass for calculator-only behavior and deployed UI split; blocked for live exact-quote intake
- Remaining unverified boundary: Valid production Firebase web/App Check values, server database credentials and IAM, approved Resend sender/recipient, actual persistence, inbox delivery, retry scheduler, and operator recovery remain unverified. Existing build warnings about inconsistent JSON import attributes and third-party Zod annotations are outside this assignment.
- Evidence or artifact: `tests/calculator.test.ts`; `tests/browser/calculator.spec.ts`; Vercel deployment `dpl_J7uvvuU7BA8LLTQWoNW2d1gvGWzS`

### 2026-09-15 — Phase 1 content and H1 audit

- Owner/task: PortableFoodBank Phase 1 — CONTENT + H1
- Environment and URL: Current local `dist` snapshot and live candidate `https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/`
- Change or requirement tested: Inventory all current rendered page families; verify H1 counts; compare representative live/local H1s; prepare multi-family content and H1 proposals without implementation
- Commands/checks performed: Parsed all local `dist/**/index.html` files with Cheerio; classified page families; counted state/region heading-pattern distribution; fetched and parsed 16 representative live routes; inspected source data for the 22 ft shower configuration; parsed the new CSV with PowerShell `Import-Csv`; ran scoped whitespace/diff validation
- Observed result: 650 local rendered pages were inventoried; all 650 have exactly one H1. All 16 representative live routes returned HTTP 200 with exactly one H1 and matched local H1 text. Four weak generated patterns affect 23 of 50 state pages and 119 of 246 region pages. The proposal CSV contains 49 data rows and all required mapping fields.
- Pass/fail: Pass for audit completeness and artifact integrity; implementation remains pending owner decisions
- Remaining unverified boundary: No content/H1/source change was implemented. The owner must confirm homepage handling, generated-location assignments, the 22 ft unit’s flagship/three-sink specification, dishmachine brands, institutional/procurement claims, protected URLs, and city operational briefs. Live browser visual rendering beyond source-HTML H1 verification was not part of this audit.
- Evidence or artifact: `docs/phase1/CONTENT_H1_AUDIT.md`; `audit/phase1-content-h1-mapping.csv`

### 2026-09-15 — Exact-service carousel integration

- Owner/task: PortableFoodBank image/carousel — IMPLEMENTATION
- Environment and URL: Local production build served at `http://localhost:4173/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Exact inventory mapping; responsive derivative generation; deterministic interior, exterior, then remaining order; server-rendered first image; deferred later images; native controls; arrow/Home/End keys; horizontal swipe; vertical-gesture preservation; inactive-alt suppression; truthful unverified-route fallback; and removal of mislabeled homepage Shower/Restroom imagery
- Commands/checks performed: `python scripts/build-service-hero-assets.py`; `npm run build`; `npx vitest run tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts --reporter=line`; a Chromium smoke loop through all ten mapped routes that decoded the first image, activated/decoded the second image, and checked image counts; scoped Prettier; `git diff --check`; Chromium screenshots and element-level visual inspection at 1440×1000 and 390×844
- Observed result: Ten exact routes use 54 approved inventory images and 108 generated 480/960 WebP derivatives totaling 9.71 MiB. Static generation completed for 650 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Five focused unit/server-render tests and six Chromium tests passed. All ten route-smoke checks rendered one carousel and successfully loaded the first and activated second images. Tests observed interior-first/exterior-second order where an exterior exists, control and keyboard navigation, swipe behavior, viewport containment at both widths, non-photo fallback on an unverified model, and zero images in the two corrected homepage cards. Desktop/mobile screenshots showed the carousel and controls within the layout; portrait equipment photography is intentionally contained rather than cropped.
- Pass/fail: Pass for local implementation and focused actual-route QA
- Remaining unverified boundary: Production behavior is unchanged because deployment was prohibited. Exact imagery remains unavailable or unsafe for 26 ft bulk kitchen; exact 22/24/26 ft dishwashing variants; unresolved 38 ft dishwashing identity; 30 ft laundry; 12 ft and 40 ft refrigeration; 22 ft shower-only; 20 ft restroom-only; 30 ft combination; ADA combinations; sleeper trailers; and 24 ft laundry. The 13 ft combination route has only two approved interiors, and the 28 ft kitchen route has no approved exterior. The build retains pre-existing JSON-import consistency and third-party Zod annotation warnings.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/ServiceHeroCarousel.tsx`; `src/serviceHeroImages.ts`; `src/service-hero-carousel.css`; `public/service-hero-carousel.js`; `public/images/service-heroes/`; `scripts/build-service-hero-assets.py`; `src/ServiceDetail.tsx`; `src/Equipment.tsx`; `src/homepage.css`; `tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx`; `tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts`; `tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts`; `work/qa/service-carousel/`; `docs/phase1/DRIVE_ASSET_INVENTORY.md`

### 2026-09-15 — Google Drive equipment-image inventory and classification

- Owner/task: PortableFoodBank image/carousel — ASSET INVENTORY AND CLASSIFICATION
- Environment and URL: Read-only inspection of the 20 supplied Google Drive references; local inventory artifact only
- Change or requirement tested: Enumerate every accessible image; classify interior, exterior, detail, diagram, duplicate, or unusable; record orientation and exact Drive file identity; select deterministic best-interior and best-exterior positions; identify asset and route-model gaps
- Commands/checks performed: Enumerated every supplied folder through the Google Drive connector; followed the nested actual 20ft Laundry Container folder; downloaded accessible images for contact-sheet review; extracted image dimensions, orientation, SHA-256 hashes, and Drive metadata; visually inspected all contact sheets; validated the finished Markdown for 20 detailed folder sections and 115 detailed image rows
- Observed result: 133 direct items were found: 112 direct images, 20 child equipment folders inside the incorrectly supplied laundry parent, and one `.DS_Store`. The nested actual laundry folder added 3 images, for 115 visually inspected images total. Every image was accessible after retry. Seven groups contain both interior and exterior views. Two exact duplicate pairs, one refrigerated near-duplicate, ambiguous laundry model identity, missing views, non-commercial backgrounds, and current service rows without exact folders are documented.
- Pass/fail: Pass for inventory completeness and classification artifact integrity; not approval to implement every supplied image
- Remaining unverified boundary: The owner must confirm ambiguous model identity, the shared 22–26ft dish mapping, and the correct 38ft conveyor set; replacement commercial-setting and missing-view images are still needed. No route integration, source edit, commit, publish, or deployment was performed.
- Evidence or artifact: `docs/phase1/DRIVE_ASSET_INVENTORY.md`

### 2026-09-15 — Full page inventory and live sitemap reconciliation

- Owner/task: Temporary Kitchen 123 — ALL PAGES + SITEMAP
- Environment and URL: Local generated `dist` inventory and live preview `https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/`
- Change or requirement tested: Enumerate every registered page; reconcile generated HTML, live HTTP behavior, robots directives, canonicals, and membership in the live `sitemap.xml`
- Commands/checks performed: Parsed `audit/build-registry.json`; checked the corresponding local HTML file for every route; fetched all 650 live preview URLs; parsed each response's robots meta and canonical; fetched and parsed the live sitemap and robots file; validated the resulting CSV for row and URL uniqueness
- Observed result: 650 unique registered routes and 650 corresponding local HTML files. All 650 live URLs returned HTTP 200, with 0 redirects and 0 request errors. Every live page carried `noindex,follow`, 0 pages exposed a canonical, and the valid live sitemap contained 0 URLs. The registry also reported 0 routes indexable in the current preview build.
- Pass/fail: Pass for complete route enumeration and current preview reconciliation. The preview sitemap is intentionally empty and must not list noindex Vercel URLs.
- Remaining unverified boundary: Canonical-domain routing, first-batch production activation, index/follow output, self-referencing `portable-food-bank.com` canonicals, production sitemap membership, Search Console submission, and Google indexation were not enabled or verified. Content approval of all 650 pages is not implied.
- Evidence or artifact: `docs/phase1/ALL_PAGES_SITEMAP_AUDIT.md`; `audit/all-pages-sitemap.csv`; `audit/all-pages-sitemap-summary.json`

### 2026-09-16 — Owner-approved homepage Shower Trailer image

- Owner/task: PortableFoodBank — approved Shower Trailer homepage image
- Environment and URL: Local component/render harness using the current source and static preview assets at `http://localhost:4173/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Replace the incorrect shower/restroom-combination homepage Shower thumbnail with Charles's explicitly identified Shower Trailer image; preserve responsive delivery and truthful labeling without asserting an exact model
- Commands/checks performed: Generated 480 x 640 and 960 x 1280 WebP derivatives with FFmpeg; ran `npm run build`; ran the focused Playwright homepage assertion; rendered the actual `Cards` component server-side and exercised it in Chromium at 1440 x 1000 and 390 x 844; checked decoded image dimensions, `src`, `srcset`, alt text, `object-fit`, and document overflow
- Observed result: TypeScript and Vite client build passed. The actual component emitted `/images/catalog/shower-trailer-960.webp` with its 480/960 responsive source set and the category-specific alt text. Chromium decoded the image at both viewports, rendered it with `object-fit: cover`, and measured zero horizontal overflow on mobile.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the affected component, responsive image delivery, and browser rendering. The full production build and normal page-level Playwright route could not complete because the active prerender workstream imports `audit/phase1-top-25-authority-urls.csv` as an unsupported module (`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`); the static preview therefore had an empty SSR root.
- Remaining unverified boundary: The complete prerendered homepage and live Vercel deployment were not verified or changed. The supplied image establishes the Shower Trailer category only, not an exact length, stall count, or route-level model. Restroom imagery was not changed by this task.
- Evidence or artifact: `public/images/catalog/shower-trailer-480.webp`; `public/images/catalog/shower-trailer-960.webp`; `src/Equipment.tsx`; `tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts`

### 2026-09-16 — Full PortableFoodBank review sitemap export

- Owner/task: Temporary Kitchen 123 — sitemap review export
- Environment and URL: Local repository artifact for the future canonical origin `https://portable-food-bank.com`; no deployment or Search Console submission
- Change or requirement tested: Generate a complete owner/dev review sitemap without weakening the preview noindex gate or changing the official controlled production sitemap
- Commands/checks performed: Generated `public/sitemap-review.xml` from all paths in `audit/build-registry.json`; parsed the XML with PowerShell's XML parser; counted URL and unique URL nodes; validated every hostname
- Observed result: Valid XML containing 650 URL entries, 650 unique URLs, and 0 non-`portable-food-bank.com` hosts. First URL is `https://portable-food-bank.com/`; final sorted URL is `https://portable-food-bank.com/video/`. File size is 58,569 bytes; SHA-256 is `945B1DAAA65AF4BAE7912D1CBCB87B9C9B904E413C3BDF6F6B4A2F37E37D0CFF`.
- Pass/fail: Pass for complete review export and XML integrity
- Remaining unverified boundary: The review export does not approve all pages for indexing and was not deployed, linked from robots.txt, submitted to Search Console, or checked against the future production host. The official `sitemap.xml` remains gated until the canonical domain and first approved indexing batch are ready.

### 2026-09-16 — Port Angeles shower-trailer individual-room wording

- Owner/task: Current task — Port Angeles individual-room wording
- Environment and URL: Local source and server-rendered `CityDetail` component for `/service-areas/washington/olympic-peninsula/port-angeles/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Append `with individual rooms` to the linked text `22 ft shower trailer rentals, 10 stalls` on Port Angeles only, without changing its destination, H1, or the shared wording on other city pages
- Commands/checks performed: Ran `npm run typecheck`; ran `npx vite build`; rendered Port Angeles and Sequim through `CityDetail` with `react-dom/server`; checked the exact Port Angeles phrase, absence of that phrase on Sequim, and the unchanged Port Angeles H1; ran `git diff --check`
- Observed result: TypeScript and the Vite production client build passed. The server-rendered Port Angeles page contains exactly `22 ft shower trailer rentals, 10 stalls with individual rooms`; Sequim retains the shared label without the suffix; Port Angeles retains one `Kitchen Trailer Rental in Port Angeles, Washington` H1. `git diff --check` reported only pre-existing line-ending warnings and no whitespace errors.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the requested local behavior and regression boundaries
- Remaining unverified boundary: The Vite development shell cannot provide a page-level browser render because this app expects prerendered HTML, and the full prerender remains blocked by the separately owned CSV-module import error already recorded above. The live Vercel page was not changed or post-deployment tested.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/CityDetail.tsx`

### 2026-09-16 — Boss-approved PortableFoodBank H1 plan

- Owner/task: Current task — Boss H1 implementation
- Environment and URL: Local production build and static preview at `http://localhost:4173/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Apply the approved non-home H1 formula using a source-supported service/facility topic plus rental intent and location where applicable; keep one H1 per page, align the document title, rotate deterministically, and preserve held or unsupported subjects
- Commands/checks performed: `npm run build`; `npm test`; `npm run check:headlines`; `npx vitest run tests/h1-plan.test.ts`; focused Playwright runs for `tests/browser/location-refresh.spec.ts` and `tests/browser/site.spec.ts`; direct inspection of generated homepage, service-area, state, city, and exact-model HTML; `git diff --check`
- Observed result: TypeScript, Vite, and prerender completed for 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. All 44 existing automated tests passed. The headline audit checked 548 location pages with 548 unique H1s and zero issues. Four focused unit tests passed. Seven responsive location/industry/planner Chromium tests plus the exact-model H1/title Chromium test passed. Representative generated pages each had exactly one H1 and an aligned title, including California, Texas, Port Angeles, and the 22 ft 6-stall combination trailer. The homepage H1 remained `Temporary Facilities and Trailer Rental / Rent or Lease Nationwide`.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the approved local H1 implementation and affected runtime behavior
- Remaining unverified boundary: No commit or Vercel deployment was performed. Live `portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app` output, future `portable-food-bank.com` production metadata, canonical/indexing activation, and Search Console behavior were not changed or verified. Seattle and Sequim editorial H1s, unsupported brand/specification claims, dishwashing, and refrigeration wording remain held or unchanged by design.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/rentalHeadlines.ts`; `src/StateDetail.tsx`; `src/CityDetail.tsx`; `src/Site.tsx`; `scripts/prerender.tsx`; `scripts/check-location-headlines.mjs`; `tests/h1-plan.test.ts`; focused browser tests

### 2026-09-16 — Service-area state modal H1-rule wording

- Owner/task: Current task — state modal H1-rule wording
- Environment and URL: Local production build and static preview at `http://localhost:4173/service-areas/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Reuse each dedicated state page's approved H1 wording in the corresponding map modal without introducing a second page-level H1 or removing the dedicated state-guide route
- Commands/checks performed: `npm run build`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/state-services.spec.ts tests/browser/location-refresh.spec.ts --reporter=line`; focused rerun of `tests/browser/state-services.spec.ts`; scoped Prettier and `git diff --check`
- Observed result: TypeScript, Vite, and prerender completed for 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. All 8 focused Chromium tests passed across desktop and mobile; the focused state suite passed again after adding the semantic regression assertion. California, New Hampshire, and Texas modal names matched `stateRentalHeadline(...)`; the modal title remained an `h2`, `/service-areas/` retained one `h1`, and state-guide links continued to point to dedicated state routes.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the requested local modal behavior and regression boundaries
- Remaining unverified boundary: No Vercel deployment was requested or performed, so `https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/service-areas/` remains unchanged and was not post-deployment tested. The pre-existing formatting warning in `src/main.tsx`, JSON import warning, and third-party Zod annotation warnings remain outside this task.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/CoverageMap.tsx`; `src/StateGuideCards.tsx`; state-headline binding in `src/main.tsx`; `tests/browser/state-services.spec.ts`; `tests/browser/location-refresh.spec.ts`

### 2026-09-16 — Cross-workstream acceptance QA handoff

- Owner/task: Task `01a08152-5280-7802-83d5-35eb5844c05c` — QA gate
- Environment and URL: Shared local worktree and static preview at `http://localhost:4173/`; read-only QA, no deployment and no real inquiry submission
- Change or requirement tested: Baseline acceptance coverage for H1 generation, city inventory, internal links, build/type/prerender, indexing artifacts, dashboard evidence fields, service imagery/carousel behavior, responsive layouts, and calculate-only contact isolation
- Commands/checks performed: `npm run build`; `npm test`; focused Vitest for H1/carousel/image-order tests; `npm run check:headlines`; `npm run check:cities`; `npm run check:links`; focused Chromium calculator and service-carousel suites; attempted broader location/state browser suites
- Observed result: Build/type/prerender passed and generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Headline audit passed 548/548 unique location H1s with zero issues; city and internal-link checks passed. Calculator and carousel Chromium checks passed 14/14, including no contact request from calculate-only, disabled exact-quote behavior, reduced-motion/keyboard/swipe behavior, mobile containment, and full-width hero presentation. The base test suite had 43 passes and one default-timeout failure in `tests/migration.test.ts`; that file passed 8/8 when rerun with a 15-second timeout (the affected test took 3.47 seconds). Focused image-order unit coverage found a genuine mismatch: expected `inside`, `outside`, `detail`, received `inside`, `detail`, `outside`. The dashboard imports a 650-route audit snapshot while the current build has 651 routes after adding `/seo-dashboard/`, so its route totals are stale. Broader browser runs were invalidated when another active build removed `dist/404.html`, crashing the preview server and producing connection-refused cascades. One pre-crash assertion also rejects valid approved `For Rent` wording because its regex accepts only `Rental|Lease|Facilities`.
- Pass/fail: Review needed. Core build, H1 audit, city/link audits, calculator isolation, and focused carousel interactions passed. Final gate must remain open for semantic image order, refreshed dashboard inventory, acceptance-test wording, and a single uncontended browser run.
- Remaining unverified boundary: Per lead instruction, no further builds or browser servers were launched while the carousel lane remained active. The boss task will run the clean final acceptance gate after active implementation lanes complete. Live Vercel output, production canonicals/indexability, Search Console, and downstream contact delivery were not changed or tested.

### 2026-09-16 — Accessible carousel and commercial-image presentation refinement

- Owner/task: Urgent PortableFoodBank imagery/presentation refinement
- Environment and URL: Shared local worktree and static preview at `http://localhost:4173/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Accessible auto-advance and persistent manual pause, reduced-motion behavior, interior/detail-before-exterior ordering, edge-to-edge hero media, approved homepage Shower imagery, truthful Restroom fallback, and visible-setting alt text
- Commands/checks performed: `npx vitest run tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build`; `npx vite build --emptyOutDir false`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts`; direct visual inspection of the approved Shower, combination-unit, refrigerated-trailer, and warehouse-context assets
- Observed result: Six focused unit tests and TypeScript passed. The build reached client compilation and generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Nine final Chromium checks passed, including real-page autoplay, persistent manual pause, keyboard/swipe controls, reduced motion, deterministic semantic ordering, exact-model fallback, loaded images, mobile/desktop containment, and edge-to-edge media geometry. The homepage assertion had passed in the earlier focused 10/10 run; in the final shared run it could not execute because another build replaced the prerendered root with the empty Vite shell while the test was running. This shared-artifact race is not evidence of a homepage behavior regression.
- Pass/fail: Implementation and focused carousel/image tests pass; final combined acceptance remains with the boss task for one uncontended build/preview run
- Remaining unverified boundary: No verified restroom-only source image exists, so the Restroom card deliberately has no photo. Image-derived geographic locations are not claimed. The shared `dist` directory was concurrently replaced during final QA; live Vercel/CDN behavior was not changed or tested.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/ServiceHeroCarousel.tsx`; `src/serviceHeroImages.ts`; `src/service-hero-carousel.css`; `public/service-hero-carousel.js`; homepage mapping in `src/Equipment.tsx`; `tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx`; `tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts`; `tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts`

### 2026-09-16 — SEO dashboard indexing and authority priority order

- Owner/task: Current task — indexing and authority first
- Environment and URL: Isolated local client build and focused Chromium-rendered dashboard layout; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Put Google indexing status first and `Authority metrics by website` second above overview/supporting dashboard sections, and match the sidebar navigation order without changing any metrics or evidence states
- Commands/checks performed: `npx vitest run tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`; `npm run typecheck`; `npx vite build --outDir work/seo-order-dist`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/seo-dashboard-order.spec.ts --reporter=line`; scoped `git diff --check`
- Observed result: All 5 focused component tests passed; TypeScript passed; the isolated Vite client build passed; the Chromium layout check confirmed indexing renders above authority metrics and authority metrics renders above overview. Navigation lists Google status and Authority metrics first. Existing Google, DA, and evidence values were not changed.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the requested local dashboard ordering
- Remaining unverified boundary: No Vercel deployment was requested or performed, so the live preview dashboard was not changed or post-deployment tested. Search Console and independent authority-provider data remain unconnected as already disclosed by the dashboard.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/SeoDashboard.tsx`; `src/seo-dashboard.css`; `tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`; `tests/browser/seo-dashboard-order.spec.ts`

### 2026-09-16 — SEO dashboard live-refresh recovery

- Owner/task: Current task - live refresh defect
- Environment and URL: Live read-only diagnosis at `https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/seo-dashboard/`; local production build and static preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/seo-dashboard/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Repair the orange `Running live production and preview checks...` status and disabled `Refreshing...` button that never settled
- Commands/checks performed: Fetched the live dashboard HTML and `/api/seo-live`; ran `npx vitest run tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx tests/seo-live.test.ts`; ran `npm run typecheck`; ran an isolated Vite production client build; ran `npm run build`; exercised the actual local prerendered dashboard in Chromium with both the real failure response and a controlled successful `/api/seo-live` response, then clicked `Refresh now` again
- Observed result: The live dashboard returned HTTP 200 and contained the frozen running/disabled server state, while the live API independently returned HTTP 200 with 19,140 bytes. Source diagnosis confirmed the page was prerendered without React hydration. After the fix, the real local API failure produced `Live check failed... Showing stored evidence.` and re-enabled `Refresh now`; the successful response produced a `Live checked` timestamp, re-enabled the button, and a manual click issued a second request. No React hydration errors were observed. The full build generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404.
- Pass/fail: Pass locally for initial fallback, automatic live check, explicit failure recovery, successful completion, and manual retry
- Remaining unverified boundary: The live Vercel page remains unchanged because this task did not deploy. Post-deployment behavior and provider data beyond the current HTTP endpoint remain unverified.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/SeoDashboard.tsx`; dashboard-only hydration block in `src/main.tsx`; `tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`

### 2026-09-16 — Google Drive source-asset download and integrity check

- Owner/task: Current task - Drive asset gathering
- Environment and URL: Local worktree; 25 supplied Google Drive folder links; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Download the supplied PortableFoodBank equipment assets into one accessible project directory without changing existing website imagery or page code
- Commands/checks performed: Google Drive folder metadata and direct-child inventory; raw Drive file downloads; exact downloaded-size comparison against Drive metadata; PowerShell recursive folder/file/byte reconciliation; Pillow `Image.verify()` across every PNG/JPEG; SHA-256 generation
- Observed result: The links resolve to the `Equipments` parent plus 24 child folders. The parent also contains an omitted `20ft Laundry Container` child. The deduplicated local collection contains 25 equipment folders, 149 images, 149 manifest rows, and 323,702,572 image bytes. All downloads matched expected sizes; Pillow verified 149 images with zero corrupt files; 149 SHA-256 entries were generated.
- Pass/fail: Pass for download completeness, local organization, byte-size integrity, and image decoding
- Remaining unverified boundary: The imagery has not been approved for any particular route, model, setting claim, or alt text. No website runtime, Git commit, push, or deployment was changed or tested.
- Evidence or artifact: `work/drive-assets-2026-09-16/README.md`; `work/drive-assets-2026-09-16/manifest.csv`; `work/drive-assets-2026-09-16/SHA256SUMS.txt`

### 2026-09-16 — Sticky Project Desk and Emergency dispatch redesign

- Owner/task: PortableFoodBank_BUILD — commercial dispatch redesign; independent QA by task `01a08152-5280-7802-83d5-35eb5844c05c`
- Environment and URL: Shared local worktree; immutable production-build copy served at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`; no production deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Compact desktop Project Desk edge tab and maximum-400 px drawer; compact mobile safe-area controls; activity-gated Emergency expansion; 24-hour dismissal persistence; one visible Emergency control; Project Desk/Emergency mutual exclusion; truthful telephone and availability actions; keyboard, Escape, focus return, reduced motion, responsive containment, and preserved quote form
- Commands/checks performed: `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build`; focused Playwright sticky-control selection; full `npx playwright test tests/browser/site.spec.ts` against an immutable preview; independent QA rerun of 11 focused Chromium checks; `npm test`; scoped Prettier check
- Observed result: TypeScript and the full Vite/prerender build passed, generating 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Implementation and independent QA both passed the 15-second-after-activity timing, no-activity hold, 24-hour localStorage dismissal, manual reopening, exact `tel:+18004435212`, single-trigger state, mutual exclusion, keyboard activation, Escape/focus return, reduced-motion override, desktop/mobile drawers, and homepage widths 320, 390, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, and 1536. The automatic panel is a labelled non-modal dialog, did not move focus or open the Project Desk, and suppressed its compact trigger while expanded. Both compact mobile controls measured 180×52 px, exceeding the 44 px touch target. Computed color pairs range from 4.57:1 to 12.54:1 for the sticky system's text. Independent visual inspection found no clipping, overlap, hierarchy, or legibility blocker. Four representative routes retained one H1, one sticky-control system, no horizontal overflow, and no console/page errors. Preview `robots.txt` remained HTTP 200 with the intentional preview policy, and the preview sitemap remained HTTP 200 and empty. The full site file passed 31/33; its two failures are unrelated stale assertions for the concurrently added Calculator navigation item and the already approved `Shower Trailer` / `Shower & Restroom Combination Facilities` labels. The base unit command passed 87/88; the sole failure came from the unrelated duplicate `work/sa-image-validation` copy where Alabama content is 511 words against that copy's 500-word ceiling. The scoped Prettier check reports existing formatting drift in shared `src/main.tsx` and `tests/browser/site.spec.ts`; broad formatting was not applied because those files contain other active owners' work.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the scoped implementation and independent acceptance criteria; combined deployment gate remains pending
- Remaining unverified boundary: Live Vercel behavior is unchanged. Deployment is intentionally held while service-area image and H1 workstreams still own shared files; deploy only after one uncontended final build/browser gate, then verify timing, persistence, mutual exclusion, telephone action, drawer form, responsive layout, and console state on the live URL.
- Evidence or artifact: Contact/Emergency markup in `src/Site.tsx`; matching interaction block in `src/main.tsx`; `src/contact-refresh.css`; focused assertions in `tests/browser/site.spec.ts`; `test-results/sticky-contact-qa/report.json`; six homepage and six open-drawer screenshots under `test-results/sticky-contact-qa/`

## 2026-09-16 — April one-photo approval and refrigeration follow-up

Implemented locally: one usable photo is sufficient; 20ft container interior-only, 20ft trailer all five Drive references, and two-stall sleeper two existing interior views. 85 focused tests, 44 app tests, 26 browser checks, 651-page build and 648 service-area audit entries passed. No deployment or indexing change. See docs/phase1/APRIL_PHOTO_APPROVALS_2026-09-16.md for the source of the approval, exact scope, evidence and revised tracker totals.

## 2026-09-16 — Existing Vercel Git source and live boss portal

- Vercel project: `cc-devs/portable-food-bank`; Git settings initially showed `charlessslaranangsss-maker/Portable Food Bank`. After removing that connection, the GitHub namespace picker showed only `charlessslaranangsss-maker` plus `Add GitHub Scope`, not `Portable-Food-Bank`. The old repo was reconnected; Git settings displayed it as connected and showed a success toast.
- Production overview after restoration: Ready, alias `https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/`, immutable deployment `EibCuYz25TKKPRLVzYvrbsNQE6FP`, source `923d3f4` on personal repo main. No new deployment or org-repo connection was verified.
- Live portal `https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/seo-dashboard/` loaded and changed from running to `Live checked 9/16/2026, 5:23:59 PM` with an enabled Refresh button. Its diagnostics tab showed Awaiting first scheduled run and missing metrics for Firestore city health, Firebase Hosting 404s, location URL failures, incomplete rows, and GSC submissions. Its Google status tab showed 0 verified indexed, 0 verified not indexed, and 25 unknown, explicitly due to absent Search Console URL Inspection evidence. Preview homepage was marked not indexable. The page warned that it is a read-only preview without owner authentication.
- Boundary: This is not proof of site-wide error-free behavior or Google indexing. Vercel overview showed 0% error rate for its displayed 6-hour window, but that metric does not cover all routes, content, external providers, or historical errors. No deployment, Git push, indexing request, or Firebase configuration change was made.

## 2026-09-16 — Batch D state route and modal alignment

- Command: `node --import tsx work/qa/batch-d-20260916/audit.mjs` (exit 0; current source SSR, not stale `dist`).
- Scope/result: 94 routes — Minnesota 11, Mississippi 11, Missouri 13, Montana 11, Nebraska 11, Nevada 11, New Hampshire 13, New Jersey 13. These comprise 8 state pages, 43 region pages, 43 city-directory pages, and zero city-detail pages in this batch.
- Modal result: 16 logical presentations, compact and full-map for each state, with 24 rendered state-guide copies checked. Zero missing/multiple page H1s, missing immediate leads, or equipment-family conflicts were reported. Directory leads correctly describe their navigation purpose.
- Review-needed shared wording: region labels can repeat state (`Northwest Minnesota, Minnesota`; `Central Mississippi, Mississippi`); generic introduction grammar can be awkward (`Arrange temporary laundry facilities long-term rental`); a generated kitchen H1 can read `Kitchen Emergency Trailer Rental`. Sent to BOSS task for the active shared-template owners. These were not treated as a pass on copy quality.
- Boundary: This verifies current React SSR output only, not the built static output, responsive browser rendering, or deployed site. No production source edit, build, commit, push, or deployment was performed by Batch D.

## 2026-09-17 — Batch D service-area alignment (local, shared checkout)

- Scope: Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire and New Jersey; 94 registered routes (8 state guides, 43 regions, 43 city directories, 0 city-detail routes) and 16 logical state-modal presentations (24 rendered guide copies across homepage and `/service-areas/`).
- Source-rendered audit: `node --import tsx work/qa/batch-d-20260916/audit.mjs` exited 0 with `problemCount: 0` after checking one H1, equipment-family lead, modal heading/lead, and the corrected state-specific focus/summary. `npm run typecheck` exited 0.
- Corrected: Mississippi and Nebraska sleeper-modal focus headings; Montana modular-kitchen modal supporting summary. No route, canonical, indexing directive, shared template, commit, push or deployment change.
- Boundary: This is source-rendered validation, not a fresh integrated build or live desktop/mobile check. Coordinator owns final integrated release verification.

## Description-only H1 audit — 2026-09-17

Completed locally only, no deploy. 651 rendered pages and 100 logical map presentations audited; 651 H1s unchanged; 34 rental-intent description corrections. Browser: 651 page visits, 200 modal viewport checks, 84 responsive page checks, 46 query viewport checks, 4 map clicks, 0 failures/errors. Build/typecheck pass; 216 targeted + 44 application tests pass. Only two production files changed: src/alignedIntroductions.ts and content/aligned-page-introductions.json. Report and exact before/after CSV: work/qa/h1-description-only-20260917/REPORT.md and description-changes.csv. 7,700-query exhaustive re-navigation not claimed. Root dist and previous work preserved.

## 2026-09-17 Panhandle lease terms — LIVE VERIFIED

The Oklahoma Panhandle 30 ft laundry trailer and 20 ft laundry container captions now include rental or lease and weekly/monthly/yearly rental terms. Live alias portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app verified on dpl_6ykocrDRHboUz1zNH2Em9b164U5Q. Both tabs and all four images decoded at desktop/mobile (eight image displays), zero content/browser/overflow failures. Preservation: 651 H1s/intros and 100 map presentations unchanged. Current tests: 209 targeted + 44 application pass; build 651 pages + 404. Preview noindex preserved. Separate primary staging was not promoted over the already-correct concurrent release. Evidence: work/qa/panhandle-lease-20260917/independent-final/REPORT.md. No further deployment is needed for this request.

**All service-area gallery captions — 2026-09-17, local review:** Updated the shared gallery caption composer with verified details for 35 image models. Existing non-Panhandle/non-Olympic galleries now lead with location, commercial use, and actual equipment, discuss weekly/monthly/yearly rental and lease options, add product-specific planning information, and end with the published 24/7 phone-assistance CTA. Approved Panhandle and Olympic captions retain priority. All 548 service-area routes and 100 map presentations passed a source-rendered caption/alt audit (572 group appearances, 1,755 images, zero issues). Fifteen focused tests and typecheck passed. Browser Vite request timed out; build/browser verification is recorded separately below when completed. No commit, push, or deployment. Review remains subject to owner acceptance.
Build finished: 651 pages + 404 prerendered. Static localhost preview at http://127.0.0.1:4315/service-areas/alabama/; 10 desktop/mobile browser checks across Alabama, Texas, Panhandle, and full/compact map presentations passed with zero image-load, caption-presence, or page-error failures. The earlier Vite dev server timed out, so review should use port 4315 while its local server runs.

## 2026-09-17 missing service-area galleries — local

`node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/audit.mjs`: 548 routes plus 100 map presentations; all 648 contain image groups; 1,434 groups, 5,325 images, zero caption/image/alt/rental/CTA issues. `npm run build`: typecheck, Vite, 651 prerendered pages plus 404 passed. Current-source focused suites: 157 assertions passed; Vitest also discovered an archived QA snapshot under `work/qa` that fails because its copied `QuoteForm.tsx` has no `../server/schema` in the snapshot. Browser on port 4315: Arkansas 2 tabs/2 captions/6 images; Arkansas Ozarks cities 3 tabs/3 captions/13 images; second tab selected successfully on both. No live deployment test.

## 2026-09-17 four urgent equipment-photo improvements — local

`npx vitest run tests/locationCarouselImages.test.ts tests/ownerImageRollout.test.tsx tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts --exclude 'work/**'`: 87/87 pass. `npm run typecheck` passed. `npm run build` passed with 651 pages + 404 prerendered. Service-area render audit: 548 routes plus 100 map presentations; 648/648 have groups, 1,544 groups, 5,697 image appearances, zero issues. Port 4315 browser: Arkansas kitchen 2 tabs/7 images, Alaska ADA 2 tabs/6 images, Florida sleeper 2 tabs/3 images, Alabama shower 1 group/6 images. Selected second tabs where present; first and second group images decoded and had positive natural width. No deployment verification.

## 2026-09-17 — Homepage Restroom card photo

- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; static HTML generated for 651 pages plus 404.
- `npx playwright test tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts --grep "uses the approved shower photo" --reporter=line`: 1 passed. Checks the homepage shower and Restroom cards, truthful image label, and decoded image width.
- Local preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4315/` refreshed and showed the Restroom card photo and combination-unit disclosure.
- Separate targeted Vitest command encountered an archived duplicate test under `work/qa/.../before/` with a missing import; the current homepage browser test passed.

## 2026-09-18 — Equipment-photo placeholder removal (local)

- `npx vitest run --exclude "work/**" tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx tests/servicesCardPhotos.test.tsx tests/ownerImageRollout.test.tsx tests/allPageAlignment.test.tsx`: **77/77 passed**. This includes all 24 service-model routes and all 25 catalogue entries having at least one reviewed image.
- `npm run typecheck`: **passed**.
- `npm run build`: **passed**; 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 prerendered.
- Generated HTML scan for `PHOTO REVIEW IN PROGRESS`, `Exact equipment photography is pending verification`, `Verified photography coming soon`, and `Verified equipment photo pending`: **0 files failed / 652 generated pages checked**.
- Targeted Playwright checks: **5/5 passed**. The checks opened every registered model/catalogue gallery and full-image view, exercised all Services/equipment-directory/homepage quick views and reset behavior, and verified the disclosed 26 ft bulk and ADA representative galleries.
- Production deployment: commit `970a287` deployed from `main` to `https://portable-food-bank.com`.
- Live HTML checks: `/services/`, the 26 ft bulk kitchen route, 12 ft refrigeration route, stair-rental route, dining-structure route and `/equipment-rental/` returned HTTP 200 with **0 pending-photo phrases**. Route-specific disclosure markers were present on the five directly rendered samples; the equipment-directory disclosure was verified after opening its modal.
- Production Playwright checks: **5/5 passed** against `https://portable-food-bank.com`. They opened every registered model/catalogue gallery and full-image view, exercised all 27 Services/equipment-directory/homepage quick-view openings and reset behavior, and rechecked the 26 ft bulk and ADA representative galleries.

## 2026-09-18 — Contact Us facility options

- `npx vitest run tests/contactFacilities.test.tsx tests/contact.test.ts tests/calculator.test.ts`: **29/29 passed**. The new option labels/values render and the request schema accepts all five values.
- `npx playwright test tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts`: **1/1 passed**. Chromium opened the actual Contact Us drawer and selected Dishwashing, Refrigeration, Sleeper, Laundry, and Sink in turn.
- `npm run typecheck`: **passed**.
- `npm run build`: **passed**; 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 prerendered.
- Production HTML: `https://portable-food-bank.com/contact-us/` returned HTTP 200 and contained all five new option values after commit `566b495` reached the Vercel alias.
- Production browser: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://portable-food-bank.com npx playwright test tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts`: **1/1 passed**; Chromium opened the live drawer and selected all five choices.
- Boundary: no synthetic inquiry was submitted because the reported defect concerned option visibility and selection, not downstream message delivery.

## 2026-09-18 — Inventory Restroom/Laundry correction

- Live pre-change audit of the 13 owner-reported product routes: **26/26 desktop/mobile presentations passed**. Each returned HTTP 200, rendered one visible service carousel with a decoded lead image, contained zero pending-photo phrases and produced zero console errors.
- Confirmed shared-menu defects: Restroom listed five shower/restroom combination models; Laundry listed only the 24 ft and 30 ft trailers.
- `npx vitest run tests/serviceMenuFix.test.tsx tests/seasonal.test.ts tests/imagePlacementScope.test.tsx`: **22/22 passed**.
- `npm test`: **44/44 passed**.
- `npm run typecheck`: **passed**.
- `npm run build`: **passed**; 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 prerendered.
- Local Chromium audit at 1440x1000 and 390x844: **2/2 menu presentations**, **4/4 family-list checks**, **4/4 gallery presentations**, and **4/4 lead images** passed with zero console errors. Restroom contains four restroom-only routes; Laundry contains all four requested choices. Both new Laundry anchors resolve on the existing category URL.
- Broader `tests/aprilPhotoPolicy.test.tsx` run: **6/7 passed**; its unrelated `Commercial Modular Kitchen` hold assertion expects zero images although the current registry returns seven. No modular-kitchen source was changed by this task.
- Production: commit `29ecf4b` was pushed only to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` main. Vercel deployment `dpl_Dop5EkVtcSjgRgoDqj7pXMXGdXkP` reached READY and the production project aliases updated.
- Live Chromium on `https://portable-food-bank.com`: **2/2 desktop/mobile menu presentations**, **4/4 family-list checks**, **4/4 new Laundry gallery presentations**, and **4/4 decoded lead images** passed with zero console errors.
- Live post-release recheck of all 13 reported product routes: **26/26 desktop/mobile presentations passed**, with HTTP 200, one visible carousel, a decoded lead image, zero pending-photo panels and zero console errors.

## 2026-09-18 — Legacy backlink URL parity and controlled indexing release

- Input inventory: **153/153 unique absolute URLs**, **105 unique paths**, **48 duplicate host/protocol rows**, from the supplied old-site backlink export.
- Live pre-change crawl: **148/153** rows ended at HTTP 200 and **5/153** ended at HTTP 404. The five failures represented three unique paths. Every successful final page returned `noindex,follow` and no canonical.
- Local parity audit after repair: **153/153 passed**, **0 failed**. This covers exact source-path recognition, permanent path mapping where applicable, built final HTML, `index,follow`, apex self-canonical, and production sitemap membership.
- Route result: **24 direct rows**, **129 redirected rows**, **23 unique canonical destinations**. The controlled release contains exactly **25 indexable pages**: those authority destinations plus the Services and Service Areas hubs.
- `npm test`: **45/45 passed** across six files.
- `npm run build`: passed; **651 pages plus 404** prerendered in production mode.
- `npm run check:release`: passed.
- `npm run check:links`: **651 pages / 0 casing issues**.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run check:seo`: completed and confirmed **25 approved routes** with index/follow, self-canonicals, and sitemap entries. Its broader `launchReady:false` status remains because unrelated inherited migration-link and orphan-page findings are outside this backlink-parity repair.
- Local `npx vercel build --yes --target production` retrieved Vercel settings and production environment metadata, then stopped with `spawn cmd.exe ENOENT`. The actual remote Vercel build completed successfully and produced READY deployment `dpl_CLEabVTivoctpYLbKg23TV39QURD` from commit `4df32c3`.
- Repository boundary: the implementation revisions through `4df32c3` were pushed only to `https://github.com/Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank.git` on `main`.
- Live post-release crawl of all **153/153** supplied source URLs: **153 passed / 0 failed**, covering 105 unique paths and 23 unique final URLs. Every final response was HTTPS apex HTTP 200, every redirect hop was permanent, the longest chain was two hops, and no loop was found.
- Live destination metadata: **23/23** emitted `index,follow`, an exact apex self-canonical, and membership in the production sitemap. `https://portable-food-bank.com/sitemap.xml` returned HTTP 200 with exactly **25 URLs**, and `robots.txt` returned HTTP 200 and declared that sitemap.
- Indexing controls: non-batch `/contact-us/` remained `noindex,follow` without a canonical; the Vercel preview alias returned `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow`.
- Boundary: these checks prove the production routing and indexability state observed at `2026-09-18T10:54:55Z`. They do not prove that Google has recrawled or indexed the URLs. The broader inherited migration-link and orphan-page findings reported by `check:seo` remain outside this scoped 153-URL repair.
- Evidence: `audit/legacy-backlink-parity-2026-09-18/live-postchange.csv`, `live-postchange.json`, `live-summary.json`, and the generated indexing registries under `audit/`.
- Final owner-requested redeployment: verified `HEAD` and `origin/main` at `57826de`, verified `origin` as `https://github.com/Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank.git`, and deployed to the already-linked Vercel project `cc-devs/portable-food-bank`. Deployment `dpl_5Ab6Vrj2byjT59y3iAKXqdy2PCTJ` reached READY and updated the production project aliases.
- Custom-domain release check: `https://portable-food-bank.com/` returned HTTP 200 from Vercel and served the exact JavaScript and CSS asset hashes generated by that deployment. Representative repaired legacy URLs, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt` also returned HTTP 200.
- Final production Playwright: `tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts` plus `tests/browser/equipment.spec.ts` passed **7/7** against `https://portable-food-bank.com`, covering all five requested Contact Us choices, all 25 equipment entries and legacy destinations, responsive catalogue images/search at four viewport widths, and mobile equipment-brief navigation.

## 2026-09-18 — All registered service pages, placeholder and image QA

- Inventory: 30 registered `/services/` routes, comprising the hub, 28 detail routes and one category route.
- Initial production browser audit: 52/60 desktop/mobile presentations passed. The 12 ft, 14 ft, 20 ft and 30 ft restroom detail URLs had no carousel in both viewports; the sweep found zero visible placeholder phrases, pending-photo elements, broken image responses or console errors.
- Root cause: four permanent redirect entries bypassed the registered detail pages, and those pages had no approved image reference if rendered directly.
- Repair: removed only those four stale redirects and reused the reviewed three-image restroom-only interior set. Each page visibly states that the images do not establish its separate length, stall count or floor plan and asks the customer to confirm dimensions, accessibility, utilities and rental or lease configuration.
- Automated checks: 118/118 focused assertions passed; the wider application run passed 119/119; TypeScript passed.
- Build: production prerender generated 655 pages plus 404, adding the four restroom detail pages.
- Local browser audit: 60/60 presentations passed at 1440x1000 and 390x844. Results: zero placeholder occurrences, zero pending-photo elements, zero broken images and zero console errors.
- Production: commit `9cbbb23` was pushed only to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` main. Vercel deployment `dpl_6zdBW8NDmn74u7ednjnu9vSWSwgq` reached READY on the linked `cc-devs/portable-food-bank` project.
- Final `https://portable-food-bank.com` browser repeat: 60/60 presentations passed at 1440x1000 and 390x844. All 30 routes returned HTTP 200 after navigation; zero placeholder occurrences, pending-photo elements, broken images or console errors were observed. The four repaired restroom pages each rendered the reviewed three-image set as one active image plus five carousel thumbnails.
- Final wording follow-up: replaced the remaining 12 ft restroom `pending specification` planning bullet with a direct request to confirm the available unit's equipment list and floor plan. The focused suite passed **109/109**, TypeScript passed, and the production build generated **655 pages plus 404**.
- Expanded final audits now reject `pending specification` in addition to the existing photo-placeholder phrases. Local static preview passed **60/60** desktop/mobile presentations. Production deployment `dpl_D26jRZbUsCLLp5nDGFjpPSZDG5st` reached READY from commit `0b59eac`; `https://portable-food-bank.com` then passed **60/60**, with **0** placeholder occurrences, **0** pending elements, **0** broken images and **0** console errors at `2026-09-18T12:21:22.909Z`.

## 2026-09-18 — Exact legacy backlink-path restoration, live verified

- Scope: 153 backlink-export rows, 105 unique paths, 104 HTML paths and one legacy image asset path.
- Restoration: all 104 HTML paths generate exact-path HTML; 90 were restored from redirects as useful planning pages and all 90 have a crawlable link from their related parent page. The image asset retains a permanent redirect to `https://portable-food-bank.com/food-services-2/`.
- Indexing: 25 backlink-ranked HTML paths passed `index,follow`, exact self-canonical and sitemap checks. The other 79 exact HTML paths passed `noindex,follow`, absent-canonical and absent-sitemap checks for the controlled rollout.
- Automated tests: `npm test` passed 49/49 across seven files, including exact same-path `www` to apex coverage for every HTML backlink path.
- Build: `npm run build` passed and generated 745 pages plus 404. The existing mixed JSON import-attribute and Rollup annotation warnings remain non-fatal.
- Generated-output audit: `python scripts/audit-legacy-url-restoration.py` passed all 153 source rows with `errors: []`.
- Local mobile browser QA: three restored exact URLs returned HTTP 200 without redirect, displayed the expected H1, emitted the expected canonical and robots values, and had no horizontal overflow. The workforce parent page exposed 22 restored internal links including the Alaska URL.
- Production deployment: commit `b0b1c01` was pushed only to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` main. Vercel project `portable-food-bank-team/portable-food-bank` deployed it as READY production deployment `dpl_2miCSP8VjRzEegTukoQ99iTQDTu4` and aliased `portable-food-bank.com` plus `www.portable-food-bank.com`.
- Live URL audit: **153/153** source rows passed; **104/104** unique HTML paths returned the exact HTTPS apex path with HTTP 200; **25/25** pilot pages had `index,follow`, self-canonical and sitemap membership; **79/79** staged pages had `noindex,follow` with no canonical or sitemap entry; **1/1** legacy asset redirected permanently; and **90/90** related parent links were present. `errors: []`.
- Host redirect evidence: `https://www.portable-food-bank.com/remote-workforce-housing-services-in-alaska/` returned HTTP **308** directly to the identical apex path.
- Production browser QA: four representative legacy routes at desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844 passed **8/8**. Every presentation returned HTTP 200 at its exact route, rendered a non-empty H1 and title, matched the expected robots/canonical policy, had no horizontal overflow, and emitted zero console or page errors.
- Evidence: `audit/legacy-url-restoration-2026-09-18/migration-map.csv`, `build-verification.json`, `live-verification.json`, `live-results.csv`, and `browser-verification.json`.
- Boundary: Google recrawl and index inclusion are external and were not claimed. The 79 later-batch pages intentionally remain `noindex,follow` until a separately approved controlled release.

## 2026-09-18 — Production Contact Us and calculator inquiry recovery

- Root cause: inquiries were disabled in production; the browser integration depended on build-time `VITE_*` values not present in the owner environment; and the global trailing-slash rule redirected extensionless serverless POST routes before their handlers ran.
- Repair: enabled inquiries, moved the non-secret Firebase/App Check browser settings behind `/api/public-config.json`, and submitted inquiries to `/api/contact.json`. Added physical `.json` functions for contact, delivery and SEO endpoints so Vercel does not redirect these requests.
- Credential handling: Firebase Admin accepts a full PEM private key or the full PEM encoded as base64. It rejects a truncated key or a value missing the BEGIN/END boundaries. Resend and Firebase private credentials remain server-only.
- Prior live acceptance on deployment `dpl_9WBaMyKsM9n5iUBDz7Qm8rCq19mM`: Contact Us displayed the saved-success state and reset; the rental calculator produced the expected `$5,990` result without sending during calculation, then displayed saved-success after the explicit quote request. Production logs recorded HTTP 201 for both `/api/contact.json` requests with no `delivery_pending`; this proves provider acceptance, not recipient inbox receipt.
- Durability issue found during acceptance: newer Vercel Git deployments from organization `main` omitted the uncommitted repair and overtook the verified deployment. This branch persists the repair in the organization repository so later automatic deployments retain it.
- Automated verification on the clean branch: `npm test` passed **54/54** across eight files; `npm run build` passed TypeScript, Vite bundling and prerendering of **745 pages plus 404**.
- Git-backed release: commit `d024a06` was pushed without force to `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` `main`. Vercel production deployment `dpl_sq1yeYPTj8zRwu6Sz7v7vQ1M11Zr` reached READY and owns `portable-food-bank.com` and `www.portable-food-bank.com`.
- Vercel build output contained both canonical and physical JSON functions, including `api/contact` and `api/contact.json`, confirming the repair is part of the authoritative source deployment rather than a temporary promotion.
- Final live checks on `https://portable-food-bank.com`: `/api/public-config.json` returned HTTP 200 with all five required public values present; `/contact-us/` and `/rental-calculator/` returned HTTP 200; `/api/contact.json` returned 405 for HEAD and 403 for an unauthenticated POST, both with no redirect. The 403 is expected App Check enforcement and proves the POST reached the function.
- Delivery boundary: the two earlier fictional QA submissions on the same code path returned saved-success and HTTP 201, and their server executions recorded no `delivery_pending`, demonstrating Resend provider acceptance. Recipient-mailbox receipt was not independently inspected.

## 2026-09-23 — Mobile Kitchen product-family copy regression

- Changed the legacy `TargetLegacyPage` intro and project brief to use equipment-family copy instead of the shared kitchen-only paragraph.
- Added `tests/portableFoodBankTargetCopy.test.tsx`: all 17 legacy product routes render exactly one unchanged H1; every non-kitchen route excludes meal-volume, cooking/preparation, and temporary food-service wording; the `/12ft-restroom/` intro and planning guidance identify restroom needs; `/24ft-mobile/` retains kitchen-specific copy. All assertions passed.
- Focused test command: `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/portableFoodBankTargetCopy.test.tsx tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts` — PASS, 2 files / 13 tests.
- `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit` — PASS. `git diff --check` — PASS.
- `pnpm build` ran the Vite production bundle successfully and prerendered route files, but exited with an `UNKNOWN` error while writing `audit/build-registry.json`. That file was already modified before this task and was preserved. Do not interpret this as a full build/prerender pass. Three generated restroom pages (`/12ft-restroom/`, `/14ft-restroom/`, `/20ft-restroom/`) were inspected and showed restroom-specific lead, planning guidance, and unchanged H1s.
- Commit `bd7ca10` was pushed to `main` and `codex/homepage-mobile-kitchen-brand`. GitHub combined commit status reports Vercel pending (`https://vercel.com/jhomar0021s-projects/portable-food-bank-com/J4srpdNjTScGV52fGrCoiLLyP6yo`). Direct Vercel deployment lookup returned 403 for team `jhomar0021s-projects`; no live/preview browser visit was performed.

## 2026-09-23 — Approved inventory-photo ZIP handoff and placeholder removal

- Imported the owner-attached approved product ZIPs using their folder labels plus visual review of the source photos; archive contents were staged and source images were not changed. 39 ZIP bundles / 229 source images were audited, with exact duplicate source files reused rather than duplicated. Newly represented bundles include 26 ft bulk mobile kitchen (11), 12 ft refrigerated trailer (4), 24 ft laundry (3), 20 ft refrigerated container (3), 3-stall + 1 ADA combination (8), 8-stall + 1 ADA combination (11), restroom-only references (3), dining hall (3), entry stairs (2), and generator reference (1). Responsive WebP derivatives and hashes are recorded in the approved-photo import manifest.
- Added route and category regression coverage for exact imported models and preserved legacy URL mapping, and changed no-match galleries to render no image module rather than a missing/unverified-photo placeholder. Pages with exact source evidence render their matching gallery; ambiguous models remain unpictured.
- Focused Vitest command: `vitest run tests/ownerPhotoBundleCoverage.test.tsx tests/equipmentMissingPhotos.test.tsx tests/aprilPhotoPolicy.test.tsx tests/ownerImageRollout.test.tsx tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts tests/newEquipmentPhotos.test.tsx` — PASS, 6 files / 63 tests. The suite checks all source hashes and derivatives, imported gallery counts, preserved product paths, and absence of visible “verified photography coming soon”, “exact equipment photography is pending”, “photo review in progress”, and `.service-hero-unverified` output.
- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS. Vite client production bundle — PASS; build emits non-blocking existing JSON import-attribute and large-chunk warnings. `git diff --check` — PASS. A source scan for the above user-visible missing-photo placeholder strings in `src/` returned no matches.
- Exceptions deliberately withheld: the supplied 30 ft / 10-stall shower-restroom ZIPs are byte-identical to the 13 ft / 3-stall set, so they cannot establish the larger model; some ramp images show non-commercial/residential context; 20 ft shower photos do not verify the distinct 22 ft / 10-stall offer; 20 ft refrigerated-container photos do not verify the 40 ft container offer. No user-facing placeholder remains for these gaps.
- The approved source-image import and responsive derivatives were included in commit `2b93025`, pushed to `origin/main`. The isolated current-snapshot production build generated 95 pages plus 404; local browser verification is recorded in the 2026-09-24 caption/side-by-side section above. Vercel deployment status is unverified because no project/team connection is available to this task.

## 2026-09-23 — Mobile Kitchen service-area H1 and caption alignment

- Updated the `/service-areas/` hub to the specific H1 `Nationwide Commercial Mobile Kitchen Trailer Rental Locations` with a matching immediate intro. State-map H1s remain kitchen-specific. Region H1s now use one deterministic available Portable Food Bank equipment family plus location and rental intent; reviewed city H1s now match their assigned kitchen, dishwashing, shower/restroom-combination, or containerized sleeper topic. Regional city directories use the broad `Commercial Temporary Facility Rental Locations in [region]` H1 because they index multiple equipment families.
- Replaced the service-area carousel's legacy Panhandle/Olympic copy overrides with the shared target caption path. Captions identify the displayed equipment, use Portable Food Bank and `+1 (888) 563-6507`, and no longer assert PortableFoodBank's `+1 (800) 443-5212` or unverified 24/7 support. Where there is no per-model prose entry, the location caption uses a truthful site/configuration planning fallback rather than omitting the caption.
- SSR regression command: `node ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/serviceAreaHeadingCaptions.test.tsx tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/h1-plan.test.ts` — PASS, 3 files / 18 tests. The SSR audit renders all state pages, region guides, reviewed city pages and regional city directories, checks one H1, headline/topic matching, and target-branded captions.
- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS. `git diff --check` — PASS. A full production build and live browser/deployment verification were not run; no push/deployment was made. Existing uncommitted photo-import/audit work was left in place.

## 2026-09-24 — Mobile Kitchen service-area phrase-order and caption pass

- Updated location-first service-area copy and titles for state, region, reviewed-city, city-directory, calculator-backed location, and map-modal presentations. Corrected the directory H1 order without changing any URL/slug.
- Centralized gallery caption structure as location → topical equipment/service form → Rental or Lease → product-specific planning detail → Portable Food Bank 24/7 live-agent phone CTA.
- `node ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaHeadingCaptions.test.tsx` — PASS, 2 files / 13 tests. SSR coverage checks all 50 state pages, all generated regional guides, every reviewed city and regional city directory; it also checks target calculator state/city pages, one H1, location-first leads, no common backwards rental/location wording, and one fully populated caption per service carousel.
- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS.
- `git diff --check` — PASS (Git emitted only existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy notices).
- Included in commit `2b93025` pushed to `origin/main`; Vercel deployment status is unverified because no project/team connection is available to this task.

## 2026-09-26 — Initial deployment to Portable Food Bank Vercel team

- Vercel project: `portable-food-bank-com`, team `Portable Food Bank Pro` (`portable-food-bank-team`); Git repo `Portable-Food-Bank/portable-food-bank.com`, branch `main`.
- Production deployment `dpl_29ymkYhAqwJ8Ye7TRGYVr9EF2Epz`, commit `fb159299cca6f6b43c01ad46308a3d450c05141b`, reached **Ready** after 3m47s. Vercel build completed; its output included the existing Vite large-chunk-size warning.
- Browser verification on `https://portable-food-bank-com-theta.vercel.app/`: homepage title and main content loaded; key navigation, inventory, calculator, and service-area map were present.
- Browser verification passed on `/modular-kitchen-facilities/` and `/equipment-rental/mobile-kitchen-trailers/`; both returned their intended page titles, H1/content, navigation and page body rather than a missing-page screen. Mobile-kitchen category carousel and approved gallery were present.
- This is a new standalone Vercel project and generated Vercel domain. The existing `portable-food-bank.com` custom domain was not transferred or attached. Deployment dashboard shows production environment on `main`.

## 2026-09-29 — Whole-site audit and release candidate

- Scope and baseline: audited the isolated `Portable-Food-Bank/portable-food-bank.com` checkout from baseline `f7d14aaaa9a0d3f5d091a801ed25141d9f2eb7eb`. The authorized release target is only Vercel team/project `portable-food-bank-team/portable-food-bank-com` (`prj_4Xktb9zJ8Y39Ezh391gKoVsIoY38`). The separate `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` repository, project, and domains were not touched.
- Homepage acceptance: the H1 and primary actions lead with mobile-kitchen rentals; the opening copy names mobile showers, shower/restroom combinations, mobile kitchens, man camp/workforce housing, refrigeration/freezer, and dishwashing; the family cards sit directly below that copy. The rendered desktop portfolio uses a 1fr/3fr grid: one primary mobile-kitchen card occupies approximately 25% of the row and five supporting cards occupy approximately 75% collectively, while the primary card remains the largest individual card. The mobile layout stacks the same complete set for legibility. Desktop and 390 px mobile browser assertions passed.
- Route/render inventory: the production build generated **664 public/static routes plus 404**. A generated-output audit inspected **665 HTML files, 85,330 links, 12,154 images, 664 structured-data payloads, and 670 forms** with **0 failures**. The sole warning is the intentional draft-only canonical on `/service-areas/oklahoma/panhandle/`; it remains `noindex` and outside the empty public sitemap.
- SEO and migration safety: `npm run check:seo` passed **665 HTML files**, **77,041 local links**, **12,154 images**, and **665 unique titles/descriptions** with `problems: []`. `npm run check:links` passed **664 pages / 0 missing internal destinations / 0 capitalization issues**. `npm run check:cities` passed **19,702 Census places, 246 directories, and 5 reviewed city pages**. `npm run check:headlines` passed **548 location-page headlines**. Twenty-four non-root paths imported from PortableFoodBank authority evidence are deliberately excluded from Mobile Kitchen generation, indexing routes, internal links, and Search Console targets. The cross-domain register is retained only as clearly labeled, non-clickable historical evidence. Indexing remains deliberately disabled: generated pages stay `noindex,follow`, the public sitemap remains empty, and no Search Console, DNS, or indexing action was taken.
- Application checks: `npm run typecheck` passed. `npm test` passed **13 files / 74 tests**. `npm run build` passed and generated the route inventory above. The build retains non-fatal warnings for mixed JSON import attributes, third-party Zod annotations, and a roughly 3.0 MB/785 KB gzip main chunk.
- Vercel candidate build: linked the isolated checkout to `portable-food-bank-team/portable-food-bank-com` and verified `.vercel/project.json` reports exact project ID `prj_4Xktb9zJ8Y39Ezh391gKoVsIoY38`. `npx vercel build --prod --yes --scope portable-food-bank-team` completed successfully, including the 664-page-plus-404 prerender and serverless-function packaging. This proves the candidate can be packaged for the named project; it is not deployment or live proof.
- Browser checks: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4180 npx playwright test tests/browser/mobile-kitchen-release.spec.ts tests/browser/homepage-map-modal.spec.ts` passed **10/10**. Coverage includes desktop/mobile homepage acceptance, keyboard and focus behavior in the coverage map, all seven Texas region links, two separately hydrated quote-form islands, authored state/region/directory/industry/reviewed-city routes, 404 behavior, redirect query preservation, security headers, and the intentionally disabled inquiry flow. No inquiry was submitted. An unrelated stale server already listening on port 4173 initially produced five invalid failures; pinning the suite to the current build on port 4180 resolved all ten checks.
- Source/security checks: `npm run check:secrets` scanned **1,061 files** with `findings: []`; `npm run check:release` passed the current noindex release scope. `npm run check:security` remains an expected blocker because its 2026-09-11 evidence ledger is stale/incomplete and 18 controls lack current in-directory or external proof. `npm audit --omit=dev --json` reports **2 moderate**, **0 high**, and **0 critical** production advisories through `gaxios@6.7.1 -> uuid@9.0.1`; the affected chain is transitive through Firebase Admin/Google Cloud Storage.
- Broader test-debt boundary: the repository's ad hoc broad Vitest commands are not the supported test script. Excluding browser and Firebase-rules files still surfaced **14 failing files / 109 failing tests / 34 passing files / 488 passing tests / 7 skipped tests**, primarily historical assertions for removed PortableFoodBank menu/copy conventions, old H1 baselines, a missing ignored QA fixture, and two timeouts. These failures predate or contradict the current Mobile Kitchen source contract and were not suppressed; the designated `npm test` suite and the release-specific browser suite both pass.
- Release state at this checkpoint: **implemented locally; not yet committed, pushed, deployed, or live-verified**. Production identity and post-deployment evidence will be appended only after direct verification.

## 2026-09-30 — State-directory label spacing live follow-up

- Public GET checks returned HTTP 200 for `https://portable-food-bank-com-theta.vercel.app/` and `/locations/`; server-rendered directory HTML on both contains `Alabama 353 listed locations` with a separator.
- Browser check initially found the already-open homepage tab still displayed an older client-rendered `353 city pages` label. Reloading that tab caused it to render the current homepage content and `353 listed locations`. The `/locations/` tab showed `353 listed locations` before and after reload.
- Visually inspected homepage directory rows after refresh; state names and counts are separated, including `Georgia 405 listed locations`, `Illinois 778 listed locations`, and `Massachusetts 551 listed locations`. Accessibility-tree inspection confirmed the same on `/locations/`.
- No application source change was needed during this follow-up. The Vercel deployment API rejected the available team scope with 403 and this checkout has no `.vercel/project.json` or installed `vercel` command; therefore the exact deployed commit identity was not verified.

## 2026-09-30 — Portable Food Bank-style state directory interaction

- Compared the live Portable Food Bank `/service-areas/` directory. Its state directory shows each state as a link and a separate native “Regions and cities in [State]” disclosure; expanding Alabama revealed its published region-guide links.
- Updated the shared `MapLocationDirectory` used by homepage and `/locations/` to match that structure. The Portable Food Bank state links remain root-level; region disclosures link only to registered Portable Food Bank `/service-areas/{state}/{region}/` routes. Removed state-total copy because it is not present in the reference design. Kept target brand styling and used native details/summary behavior.
- `node ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/mapLocationDirectory.test.tsx` — PASS, 1/1. Regression checks all 50 state links, 50 disclosure controls, and every region path from `stateGuides`.
- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS. `pnpm build` — PASS, 664 static routes + 404. Existing warnings remain for JSON import attributes, third-party Zod annotations, and the large client bundle.
- Generated HTML inspection: homepage and `/locations/` each contain all 50 state links and the Alabama North Alabama region target; `/locations/` has exactly 50 state `<details>`. Build output contains no old `listed locations` totals.
- Source commit `43e92eb` was pushed to `origin/main`. Live browser verification on `https://portable-food-bank-com-theta.vercel.app/` and `/locations/` confirmed both pages render the directory and expanding Alabama reveals North Alabama, Central Alabama, Wiregrass, and Gulf Coast links. Exact Vercel deployment ID and commit metadata remain unverified because the available API scope returned 403.
