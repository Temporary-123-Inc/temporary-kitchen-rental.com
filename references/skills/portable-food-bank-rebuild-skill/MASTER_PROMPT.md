 

MANDATORY EXECUTION CONTRACT — NO SILENT OMISSIONS
These requirements override any suggestion that a similar-looking mockup, successful build, or partially connected website counts as completion.
OBJECTIVE
Rebuild the supplied OLD_WEBSITE_URL using the approved PortableFoodBank website’s actual layout and reusable functionality, while preserving the old website’s identity, assets, existing directory structure, filenames, and public URLs.
MASTER LAYOUT:
[https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/](https://portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app/)
MASTER REPOSITORY:
[https://github.com/charlessslaranangsss-maker/Portable Food Bank](https://github.com/charlessslaranangsss-maker/Portable Food Bank)
This is the user-designated working repository to inspect and use for authorized commits. Before committing or deploying, verify the local checkout's `git remote -v`, current branch, project coordination files, and Vercel project linkage. The public repository page alone does not prove that `portable-food-bank-nine.vercel.app` deploys from this exact remote or branch; confirm that connection in the authorized project settings. Do not commit to the older `Portable-Food-Bank/Portable-Food-Bank` address merely because it appeared in an earlier brief.
Do not modify or overwrite the master website while rebuilding another website.
1. USE THE ACTUAL MASTER IMPLEMENTATION
Inspect the current master repository and rendered website.
Reuse the actual compatible components, styles, assets that belong to the template, and business-logic implementations for:
- Overall website layout.
- Header, navigation, and footer.
- Homepage section structure.
- Inventory and individual equipment pages.
- Homepage map.
- Dedicated Service Areas map.
- Location modals and dedicated location pages.
- Carousels and full-image lightboxes.
- Homepage and dedicated-page calculator.
- SEO dashboard.
- Sticky contact interface.
- Emergency assistance popup.
Do not substitute a generic template or an approximate recreation when the actual source is accessible.
Record the source revision used.
If source access is unavailable, report that exact replication is blocked. Continue safe discovery, but do not claim that a screenshot-based approximation is an exact copy.
2. PRESERVE THE TARGET WEBSITE
The old website supplies:
- Business identity.
- Logo.
- Contact details.
- Relevant content.
- Equipment and service information.
- Authorized images.
- Existing public URLs.
- Existing supplied directory names, hierarchy, and filenames.
The master supplies the presentation and reusable functionality.
Do not overwrite the target website’s identity with PortableFoodBank branding or contact information.
Do not rename, delete, relocate, or replace existing target directories and files merely to fit the master’s structure.
Use additive components, adapters, and configuration where necessary.
If an architectural conflict prevents preservation, report the conflict before changing that structure.
Preserve existing valuable URLs at their exact paths with relevant content. Do not substitute redirects or move them into a different section without explicit approval.
3. ACCOUNT FOR EVERY PAGE AND IMAGE
Build a complete inventory from all accessible sources:
- Existing local directory.
- Repository.
- Public crawl.
- Sitemaps.
- CMS/media exports where available.
Reconcile the sources.
For every original page and image, record:
- Original URL or path.
- New usage or preserved destination.
- Migration status.
- Verification result.
- Reason if excluded.
- Access blocker if unavailable.
Preserve original image files and create optimized derivatives separately.
Reuse the old website’s logo.
Do not claim all assets were migrated if some could not be accessed.
Do not place unrelated images on a page merely to use every image.
4. ENFORCE CONTENT AND IMAGE MATCHING
Every service-area modal, dedicated location page, and inventory page must have consistent:
- H1.
- Description.
- Equipment family.
- Equipment type and verified size.
- Images.
- Specifications.
- Metadata.
- CTA.
- Internal links.
Apply the complete Kermit website-family and H1 rules from the master specification.
Do not mix:
- Shower-only units with shower/restroom combinations.
- ADA and non-ADA equipment.
- Sleeper bunk-bed trailers with unrelated accommodation units.
- Kitchen, dishwashing, refrigeration, or laundry content.
- Different locations.
Use shared structured data for modals and dedicated pages to prevent contradictions.
Run automated checks across every known affected route and manually review ambiguous associations.
5. REQUIRE BOTH MAP PLACEMENTS
Implement the map on:
- The homepage.
- The dedicated Service Areas page.
Both must use consistent location data.
Verify:
- Every supported state interaction.
- Correct modal title and description.
- Correct image collection.
- Correct city/state associations.
- Correct dedicated-page destination.
- Keyboard and mobile usability.
- Readable HTML navigation to published location pages.
A map that merely displays visually is not complete.
6. REQUIRE ONE SHARED CALCULATOR
The homepage and dedicated calculator must use the same calculation engine and approved configuration.
Verify:
- State selection.
- City dropdown filtered by state.
- All valid dataset cities included.
- City reset when state changes.
- Equipment selection.
- Applicable trailer lengths.
- Approved starting-price arithmetic.
- Date validation.
- People-based pricing where applicable.
- Clear exclusions.
- Estimate versus final-quote distinction.
- Contact submission behavior.
Do not invent city-specific delivery prices, rental-duration multipliers, or equipment availability.
Test boundary cases and invalid inputs.
7. REQUIRE A REAL SEO DASHBOARD
The dashboard must use verified data sources.
Every metric must identify:
- Source.
- Last checked time.
- Coverage.
- Connection status.
- Whether it is live, imported, historical, or unavailable.
No fabricated:
- Indexed-page counts.
- DA or DR scores.
- Ranking positions.
- Historical graph points.
- Performance results.
- Healthy connection badges.
Implement the requested tabs, graphs, protected URL register, technical checks, and diagnostics.
Where an integration is unavailable, display an honest unavailable/blocked state—not a fake number.
Do not describe partially inspected URLs as full-site indexing coverage.
8. VERIFY THE PLATFORM CONNECTIONS
Verify the correct:
- Company GitHub repository.
- Company Vercel team and target project.
- Firebase project and authorization.
- Resend configuration or approved email alternative.
Plugin installation alone is insufficient.
Test actual permitted operations.
Keep secrets server-side and outside source control.
Do not copy the master website’s credentials or project identifiers.
Do not create duplicate projects, change billing, or replace production domains without authorization.
9. TEST THE COMPLETE USER EXPERIENCE
Test desktop and mobile:
- Navigation.
- Both maps.
- Modals.
- Carousels.
- Image lightboxes.
- Both calculators.
- Contact interface.
- Emergency popup.
- Form validation and submission.
- Admin authorization.
- Dashboard loading and error states.
Verify forms through:
Browser → server validation → persistence → notification → visible result.
Record any delivery boundary that cannot be verified.
Compare the rebuilt website with the approved master using screenshots at matching viewport sizes.
Document intentional branding and content differences.
10. PROTECT DEPLOYMENT
Use the target website’s deployment project—not the master project.
Before release:
- Preserve recoverable backups.
- Record the deployment revision.
- Verify route preservation.
- Confirm target branding and contact details.
- Verify environment configuration.
- Check canonicals, sitemaps, and indexing directives.
- Document rollback.
Deploy a preview first.
Production cutover requires the appropriate authorization.
After deployment, test the actual deployed website again.
11. COMPLETION MUST BE EVIDENCE-BASED
Create a final acceptance matrix:
Requirement | Implementation location | Test performed | Evidence | PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED
Include separate rows for:
- Master-layout reuse.
- Branding and logo.
- Directory and filename preservation.
- Public URL preservation.
- Asset migration coverage.
- H1/description/image consistency.
- Homepage map.
- Service Areas map.
- Location modals.
- Dedicated location pages.
- Carousels and lightboxes.
- Homepage calculator.
- Dedicated calculator.
- SEO dashboard.
- Firebase.
- Email delivery.
- Sticky contact.
- Emergency popup.
- Mobile and keyboard usability.
- Security and authorization.
- Deployment.
- Live verification.
Do not mark a requirement PASS based only on source code, a successful build, or HTTP 200 when runtime verification is required.
Do not omit failing requirements from the report.
A BLOCKED item is not completed.
Continue correcting failures within the authorized scope. If external access or a business decision is required, finish independent work and report the precise blocker.
Only describe the requested rebuild as complete when every mandatory requirement has passed its applicable acceptance checks.
START WITH DISCOVERY AND THE ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST, THEN IMPLEMENT AND VERIFY.

12. APPLY THE APPROVED LOCATION, EQUIPMENT, AND IMAGE-COPY LESSON
For every target page and its corresponding modal, first identify the verified location, commercial customer/use case, exact equipment family and model, and genuine rental intent. Write one stable, natural H1 using this order:
City or region, State + commercial use case + correct topical equipment/service + correct facility type + rental or lease phrase.
The visible opening description, SEO title/description, equipment details, images, image captions, FAQs, CTA, and internal links must support that same subject. Rotate wording deliberately across different pages, not randomly on each visit. Do not force "mobile kitchen" onto shower, laundry, refrigeration, dishwashing, or other equipment pages. Preserve the approved homepage H1 unless a separate change is authorized.

For every visible equipment image or carousel group, write a short, direct customer-facing caption. Lead with location + relevant commercial/base-camp use + exact pictured equipment (size only when verified) + Rental or Lease. Follow with natural weekly/monthly/yearly rental or lease inquiry terms and a product-specific customer benefit. Use the next sentence for one useful product-specific detail: a practical planning benefit, as in the approved trailer example, or a photo-identity clarification, as in the approved container example. Do not force a clarification when the photos are already clear, or repeat the same generic benefit across groups. Close with the verified phone CTA; "available 24/7" refers to phone assistance only when the target site's approved information supports it, never delivery or stock. Make each caption distinct to its equipment and use, not a place-name swap or a repeated template. Both PortableFoodBank examples are boss-approved quality standards: "Oklahoma Panhandle Commercial Facility and Base Camp 20 ft Laundry Container Rental or Lease. Discuss weekly rental, monthly rental, or yearly rental and lease options for container-based washing and drying. These interior photos show the 20 ft container, not a trailer. Call us now at +1 (800) 443 - 5212, available 24/7." And: "Oklahoma Panhandle Commercial Project and Base Camp 30 ft Laundry Trailer Rental or Lease. Discuss weekly rental, monthly rental, or yearly rental and lease options for on-site washing and drying. Plan temporary laundry around your crew and workwear needs. Call us now at +1 (800) 443 - 5212, available 24/7." These are writing standards, not permission to copy Oklahoma facts, sizes, lease terms, phone hours, or equipment identity to another site. Keep source limitations and unverified technical details in review evidence rather than filling customer copy with audit language. Do not add awkward keyword strings, fabricated local details, unconditional inventory/contract promises, or filler such as "availability and site requirements are confirmed with your quote."

Keep a 20 ft laundry container distinct from a 30 ft laundry trailer; likewise keep shower-only, shower/restroom, ADA, kitchen, dishwashing, refrigeration and sleeper variants distinct. Never describe an interior container photo as a trailer exterior. Use the actual image content and verified equipment identity to choose the caption. If the image-to-model association is uncertain, flag it for review instead of inventing a description.

Write alt text separately from the visible caption. Alt text should concisely describe what the image actually shows and its relevant equipment/setting; include the verified location only when it adds truthful context. Do not paste a whole caption, repeat rental terms or city names across every image, or imply a commercial setting that is not visible. Decorative images use empty alt text. For linked or functional images, ensure the accessible name communicates the destination or action. Preserve meaningful existing filenames and source assets; optimized derivatives may be added separately. Check each responsive image and lightbox for the correct alt text and caption.

Preserve the target website's existing public URL and intended canonical relationship. For a unique indexable page, verify its canonical points to its own preferred production URL using the target site's domain, not the PortableFoodBank master or a preview domain. Do not blindly change canonicals on duplicate, redirected, parameterized, or intentionally excluded pages: inventory and document the intended preferred URL first. Keep canonical, internal links, sitemap entries, redirects, robots directives and page content consistent. Staging/preview noindex controls must not silently carry into the approved production launch, and production indexability must not be enabled on a preview by accident. A canonical tag or sitemap entry does not prove Google indexed a page.

Acceptance evidence for this section must include an inventory row for every affected page/modal and image group: URL, H1, opening description, equipment/model, image IDs, visible caption, alt text, canonical, robots/indexing intent, review status, and live verification result. Check the rendered initial HTML and the browser presentation (desktop and mobile), including both map-modal placements where applicable. Automated assertions should catch family/location mismatches and forbidden disclaimer text; manually review factual claims and ambiguous photos. After deployment, open the actual target URL and verify the captions, alt text, canonical, response status and robots header. Report any unverified fact or blocked integration explicitly; do not mark this section PASS based only on source changes or a successful build.

13. APPLY THE COMPLETE BOSS KEYWORD-FAMILY PLAYBOOK — WITHOUT KEYWORD STUFFING
Use the approved site-specific vocabulary below as a source of RELEVANT choices, not a requirement to place every keyword on every page. First classify each target website and each page by its actual primary service and verified equipment. Never transfer another website's branding, contact details, products, imagery, or unsupported claims. A multi-service website must select the correct family per page; "mobile kitchen" must not appear as the primary subject of every city-page H1.

The boss's core phrase formula is TOPICAL SERVICE + GROUP 1 FACILITY TYPE + GROUP 2 RENTAL INTENT. On a location page, place the geographic and commercial-use context first: City or region, State + commercial use case + topical service + appropriate facility type + natural rental/lease phrase. Keep topical service, facility type, and rental intent together in ONE readable phrase. Examples of the pattern, only where factually applicable: "Port Angeles, Washington Industrial Base Camp Shower Trailer Rental"; "Oklahoma Panhandle Commercial Base Camp 20 ft Laundry Container Rental or Lease"; "Commercial Kitchen Modular Building for Rent"; "Shower and Restroom Combination Facility for Rent." Do not reproduce awkward strings such as "Best Rentals Cheap Rental" or use another equipment family's topic merely to achieve variation. Each page gets one stable, relevant H1. Preserve the approved homepage H1 unless separately authorized.

Group 1 facility-type choices: trailer, facility, modular building, temporary facilities, emergency trailer; also container or equipment when that is the verified physical product. Group 2 commercial-intent choices: rental, for rent, leasing, short-term rental, long-term rental, weekly rental, monthly rental, yearly rental or lease. "Emergency" describes a verified use case or service response, not a substitute for rental intent. Combine only terms that read naturally and match what the business actually offers. Rotate suitable terms across DIFFERENT pages and supporting copy in a deterministic editorial plan; do not randomize H1s on page load. The boss's "1–8 keywords" instruction means select a small relevant mix across a page's H1, lead, captions, body, FAQs and links, not eight terms jammed into one H1 or repeated in every alt attribute.

Website-family vocabulary and boundaries:
- portable-food-bank.com: remote man camp and life-support services; shower trailers; shower/restroom combinations; ADA shower/restroom combinations; laundry trailers or containers; kitchen and commercial kitchen facilities; sleeper/bunk-bed trailers; and genuinely offered supporting equipment. Use the correct equipment on each page. Include "equipment rental" with life support only when it matches the actual offer.
- TemporaryKitchens123.com: temporary/mobile/modular/commercial kitchens, commercial dishwashing or dishwasher facilities, refrigeration and emergency refrigeration where offered. Include the commercial need for emergency response, construction and renovation in relevant page copy. Mention kitchen and dishwashing on the homepage as requested, but do not overload every service-page H1 with both. Relevant industries may include healthcare, education, correctional facilities, and government/military when supported by the business.
- IceFoxEquipment.com: refrigeration trailer, walk-in refrigeration, walk-in freezer, outdoor walk-in cooler, refrigeration container and freezer container, as actually supplied. Rotate short-term/long-term rental, leasing and sales ONLY where that transaction type is genuinely offered. Do not introduce kitchen, shower or man-camp primary keywords on an Ice Fox refrigeration page.
- Dedicated dishwashing/warewashing site: commercial dishwashing trailers/facilities, dishmachine rental and warewashing. CMA flight machine, Hobart, Champion and Jackson are possible brand/model topics ONLY when inventory, photos, service authorization and page facts verify them. Do not list all brands on an unrelated page or imply an unverified brand partnership.

For the boss's commercial-photo rule, choose images that truthfully show equipment in an appropriate commercial or institutional context when authorized assets exist: hospital or nursing facility, workforce/man camp, hotel or hospitality operation, correctional facility, military location, or industrial facility. Avoid residential-home or small-business backgrounds for these commercial service pages. Vary approved images between pages when available, but never alter dimensions merely for variety; keep responsive aspect ratios and suitable file sizes. If only an unsuitable or unverified image exists, flag it instead of manufacturing a false location or setting in the caption or alt text. The reported 22 ft flagship shower trailer and its three hand sinks may be stated ONLY after confirming the exact asset/model/specification and that it belongs on the target website. Do not carry that specification onto another shower product.

The H1, first paragraph, SEO title and meta description, equipment specifications, commercial applications, FAQs, CTA, gallery captions, image alt text and relevant internal links must tell the same service story. Use distinct helpful local/project information; do not pad city pages with generic travel, waterfront or road descriptions unrelated to the customer's commercial need. If a product specification, location claim, availability, lease term, brand relationship, emergency response or 24/7 claim has not been verified for the TARGET business, record it as missing/unverified and do not publish it as fact. A natural rental inquiry may still be invited without promising stock, a contract term or dispatch time.

Before calling this playbook complete, audit every affected state/region/city route and BOTH homepage-map and Service Areas-map modal presentations. For each, verify the topical family, stable H1, lead paragraph, caption/image pairing, factual alt text, CTA, canonical, indexing directive and live behavior. Record exact PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED counts and examples. Preserve existing high-value URL paths and their search intent; do not use keyword rotation as a reason to rename slugs or change canonicals. This playbook improves topical clarity and user usefulness; it does not guarantee rankings, indexing or domain-authority scores.

14. COMPLETE TWO TARGET-SITE INTAKE GATES BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION
Gate A — Verified services, claims and assets: Create a target-specific evidence register before writing copy, pricing, specifications or calls to action. For every service/equipment type, size, capacity, price, delivery term, rental or sales term, brand/model, 24/7 or emergency-service claim, service area, contact detail and photo, record the exact claim or asset, its source URL/file or named owner approval, verification date, target website, and status (VERIFIED / UNVERIFIED / NOT OFFERED). Cross-check the old website, supplied files and approved owner information; conflicting evidence must be flagged for a decision. Use only VERIFIED facts in published copy, calculator configuration, schema, image captions and alt text. Do not import PortableFoodBank prices, phone numbers, product specifications or claims into a different business merely because they exist in the master template. An unverified claim stays out of publication and appears in the BLOCKED/decision list with the precise evidence needed.

Gate B — Per-site feature applicability: Before copying master features, create a feature matrix for the target website. List the homepage map, dedicated Service Areas map, location modals/pages, equipment inventory/pages, carousels/lightboxes, homepage calculator, dedicated calculator, SEO dashboard, sticky contact interface, emergency popup and each external integration. For each feature record: REQUIRED / NOT APPLICABLE (owner-approved) / BLOCKED; the business reason; data and access dependencies; implementation location; and acceptance test. Existing mandatory requirements in this contract remain REQUIRED by default. Do not silently omit them or declare them NOT APPLICABLE because they are difficult or data is missing. If a focused site genuinely should not have a master feature, present the reason and obtain explicit owner approval before marking it NOT APPLICABLE; otherwise retain it as REQUIRED or BLOCKED. A feature approved as NOT APPLICABLE needs a documented alternative user path where relevant and must be shown transparently in the final acceptance matrix, not falsely marked PASS. Do not build irrelevant product choices, map destinations or calculator prices merely to mirror the master.

15. REBUILD THE RECOGNIZABLE MASTER EXPERIENCE — EXACT FEATURE CONTRACT
This section clarifies the five detailed module briefs in `references/`. For a whole-site rebuild, read all five before implementation. Use the CURRENT approved PortableFoodBank repository and preview as the visual/behavioral reference, recording their revision and date; do not infer a working feature solely from this text. Reproduce the recognizable information architecture, layout rhythm, navigation, section types, responsive treatment, and functional patterns while adapting logo, colors, photography, product families, locations, content, prices, contacts, and brand voice to the TARGET business. Do not copy PortableFoodBank identifiers or unsupported offerings. For each feature below, show the master screenshot/component, target mapping, data source, acceptance test, and intentional difference. Existing target URLs and filenames still take precedence over blindly copying master slugs.

Template structure: Audit the master homepage and target homepage section-by-section. Preserve the supported header/navigation and footer pattern; service and equipment inventory with dedicated detail pages; relevant image galleries with interior-before-exterior ordering where that makes sense; accessible auto-advance/pause controls and full uncropped lightbox; commercial applications/Industries We Serve when verified; service-area discovery; calculator workspace; contact paths; and owner-visible dashboard. On narrow screens, recombine rather than hide essential actions or map destinations. A missing master feature is BLOCKED or owner-approved N/A, never silently omitted. Do not make every rebuilt site visually identical in photos or copy: it should be recognizably the same approved system, adapted to a distinct verified business.

Contact placement and behavior: On desktop, provide the compact STICKY/FLOATING GENERAL CONTACT entry on the LEFT edge of the viewport, analogous to PortableFoodBank's contact rail. It must clearly invite a normal rental/availability inquiry and open a usable contact drawer/dialog or the approved contact path. On desktop, place the distinct 24/7 EMERGENCY/SUPPORT CALL-NOW entry at the BOTTOM RIGHT, with a working `tel:` action and a clearly labeled urgent inquiry alternative only if that flow really works. Keep the two purposes separate. Do not substitute one button for both, reverse the sides, or bury both in the footer. Brand styling and copy may vary per target, but the recognizable two-entry pattern and functions must remain. On mobile, adapt both to safe-area/keyboard space without overlap with navigation, cookie notices, map controls, calculator, or each other; maintain visible, usable access rather than forcing desktop coordinates. Use "24/7" and emergency-response wording ONLY if the target's staffing/hours and phone path are verified; otherwise use a truthful call/contact label while preserving the right-side support function. No timed popup unless separately approved. Verify keyboard, focus, Escape, dismissal, reduced motion, phone dialing, form validation, server acceptance, downstream receipt, and honest failure states. The source brief in `references/05-emergency-contact-ui.md` treats placement as flexible; THIS user-approved portfolio requirement makes left/right placement the default for rebuilds. Any exception requires owner-approved N/A/alternative in the matrix.

Two maps, one source of truth: Put an interactive state map on BOTH the homepage and the dedicated Service Areas page. They must read from the same structured, target-specific location dataset and yield consistent state names, supported coverage, modal headings/leads, images, links, and destination pages. Build the service-area hierarchy from verified coverage: state -> region/subregion when used -> county when used -> city/locality when used. Do not invent every level for every site or claim coverage merely because a map draws a state. For each location record, store a stable ID, parent ID, display name, state abbreviation/full name, canonical URL/slug if it has a page, service/equipment family, verified coverage status, commercial use case or approved generic wording, media IDs, and review/approval status. Use stable IDs and referential checks so a city cannot point to a missing/wrong county or state. A page and BOTH map modals for the same location must derive from the same approved content source; no conflicting equipment family, H1-like heading, lead, image, or CTA. If a state has no verified cities, provide an honest state-level path rather than fabricated city links. If a city is only selectable in a form, do not falsely call it a published landing page.

Service Areas content and navigation: The dedicated Service Areas page needs a useful, readable state index, links to genuinely published region/county/city pages, and an explanation of the target's actual service/equipment coverage. Keep these links and essential text in initial rendered HTML, not only JavaScript map state. A state page identifies its state, offered services, commercial applications, verified delivery/service language, and approved child locations. A region/county page identifies its parent and relevant supported cities. A city page uses City, State + commercial use case + correct topical service + physical facility type + natural rental/lease phrase; its lead, specs, gallery/captions, CTA, metadata, and links fulfill that H1. Do not pad pages with a city-name swap or generic travel prose. Supply local facts only when verified, and leave unsupported assertions out. Keep one stable H1 per indexable page, one preferred canonical URL, internally reachable links, accurate sitemap membership, and the approved preview/production robots policy. Both map presentations and every published route require desktop/mobile, keyboard, data-alignment, and live-URL verification. Reconcile route counts against the approved source inventory; report exact state/region/county/city counts and missing or excluded records.

Two calculator placements, one engine: Keep a calculator section on the homepage and one dedicated calculator page, backed by the SAME approved product/location/pricing data and calculation function. Use separate State, City, and optional ZIP controls; filter City by State and clear a stale city on change. Show equipment, applicable trailer length, dates, and number of people where relevant. Show the starting equipment-plus-delivery planning estimate without demanding personal information. A separate OPTIONAL request-for-exact-quote path may collect name/phone/email only when the secured server submission and consent flow work end-to-end. The dedicated page needs one stable website-appropriate H1 and readable initial HTML for supported states/cities, prices, delivery assumptions, and service language; do not dump thousands of thin links. The PortableFoodBank example's $995-at-20-ft delivery formula and product starting prices are NOT automatically the target site's prices: require owner-verified per-site price and product data; when missing, show an honest non-priced inquiry state instead of fabricated totals. Dates do not alter price until verified duration rules exist. Distinguish estimate, quote request, and confirmed availability. Test all valid/invalid lengths, people-based choices, date boundaries, dependent controls, mobile, raw HTML, and downstream submission if enabled. See `references/02-calculator.md` for the PortableFoodBank reference numbers and full flow.

Owner dashboard: Preserve the dashboard's information architecture from the actual master, but make every card, graph, issue list and protected-URL record evidence-labeled by site, source, coverage and timestamp. Unconnected Search Console/Ahrefs/DA/DR/PageSpeed/Firebase/Vercel data displays Unknown/Not connected, never zero or fabricated health. For a multi-site portfolio, let the owner filter each site's protected exact URLs and open live pages; distinguish Ahrefs crawl, ranking-inferred visibility, Google URL Inspection, and truly verified Google indexing. Audit authorization and avoid exposing owner data publicly. See `references/03-seo-dashboard.md` for staged diagnostics and controls. A visually faithful dashboard with fake data is a FAIL.

Content and SEO guardrails: For every page, follow sections 12–14 and `references/04-landing-pages-h1.md`. The topical service + truthful facility type + rental/lease phrase must stay together; rotate across appropriate pages, not per view. Captions can mention truthful weekly/monthly/yearly terms and approved 24/7 CTA; alt text separately describes the visible image, not a keyword list. Preserve protected historical URLs and search intent; inspect source URL inventories before publishing thousands of pages. Sitemap inclusion is not indexing, and no pacing strategy makes thin pages safe. A reusable template is allowed; near-duplicate doorway content is not.

Coordination and release: Before touching a shared repository, read its coordination files and Git status, claim the exact pages/files, and avoid files owned by other active tasks. Resolve feature applicability and URL mapping with the owner before bulk implementation or release. Do not deploy/push or switch indexing merely because this prompt exists. After assigned changes, test the actual affected behavior in the target environment and update `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `TEST_RESULTS.md`, `PAGE_ASSIGNMENTS.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` when applicable. The final report must list exact tested routes and map variants, relevant source revision, implemented versus blocked features, live evidence, and approvals still required.
